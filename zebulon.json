      "description": "**Shane Parish, Barry Archie Johnson, Paul Lai**\n\nShane Parish – the virtuosic self-taught guitarist from Athens, Georgia – visits Zebulon for a night of acoustic guitar at a free show also featuring L.A.’s Barry Archie Johnson.\n\nAthens, Georgia-based guitarist Shane Parish devotes his days to developing his singular and expressive musicianship. A self-taught musician, he is known for his orchestral finger-style solo arrangements, for his intense and intricate electric playing in the avant-rock band Ahleuchatistas, and as a member of the Bill Orcutt Guitar Quartet. His music is a fluid synthesis of many traditions, ceaselessly pushing the edges as it aims for the future. Over the years, he has released albums on labels such as Tzadik Records, Palilalia Records, Cuneiform Records, and International Anthem.\n\n“Shane Parish is a relentless interpreter. The guitarist's catalog is full of folk songs, sea shanties and the Chet Baker Sings album thoughtfully and playfully mangled. (Parish also notated and arranged Bill Orcutt's Music for Four Guitars for, well, four guitars — their Tiny Desk is raucously joyful.)”\n\n—Lars Gotrich, NPR\n\n“In the spirit of solo acoustic guitarists like John Renbourn and Bert Jansch, or American Primitivists John Fahey and Robbie Basho, Parish reinterprets canons, with a focus on a motley crew of titans of the last century: Ornette Coleman, Minutemen, Alice Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Apex Twin, Kraftwerk, Sun Ra, Roland Kirk, John Cage, and Fred Rogers.”\n\n—Repressed Records\n\n“As an arranger and transcriber, Shane has incredible attention to detail and a devotion to get it right. As a performer and improvisor, he’s passionate and has terrific drive and charisma. On stage, he’s impossible not to like.”\n\n—Bill Orcutt, quoted in Flagpole Magazine (Athens, GA)\n\nPaul Lai is best known as the guitarist and leader of Upsilon Acrux- one of Southern California's most storied and intense instrumental groups and a key proponent of an incredibly intricate, rigorous evolution of rock/prog/jazz music. He recently returned after a 5.5 year sojourn in Taipei, Taiwan – where he formed the group (Z)erpents and advanced his work in the city’s vibrant music underground.\n\nHis solo guitarwork is known as \"Scissortronics\" and has performed frequently in Taipei and Los Angeles with butoh dancer(s) and in group formats w/ Patrick Shiroishi, Dylan Fujioki, Mark Kimbrell and Heldon among others."

      "description": "**Dave Palmer, Reggie Hamilton, Joey Waronker**\n\nThe DPT is a jazz trio comprised of Joey Waronker on drums, Reggie Hamilton on bass, and Dave Palmer on piano. The group plays almost exclusively original compositions in a style more attuned to 50s and 60s swing and the compositional elements found therein. Leaning heavily on influences like Duke Ellington, Benny Golson, Horace Silver, Mingus and Monk there is an old school aura that is evenly mixed with a new, more personal touch. This ensemble is a grouping of exceptional musicians all of whom have deep and varied career experience.\n\nJoey Waronker has worked with artists ranging from his long term standing in Beck’s band and more recent touring with Roger Waters to a massive list of others including REM, Atoms for Peace, Yoko Ono, Johnny Cash, Gnarls Barkley, and SIA...to name but a few. An in demand session player and producer for many years, he is also a highly influential musician and producer in LA and beyond.\n\nReggie Hamilton’s professional career is so varied and deep it’s hard to know where to begin. He has played with artists such as David Lynch, Queen Latifah, Warren Zevon, Whitney Houston, Seal, Mariah Carey, Baby Face and George Duke...once again to name but a few. He is also a sought after session player, equally comfortable on Pop, RnB and orchestral music dates. Easily one of the most skilled and versatile bassists in LA and around the world.\n\nDave Palmer is a pianist and keyboardist who makes the bulk of his living scoring films. His body of work includes such works as The Beginners, The Greatest Beer Run Ever, Ricky Stanicky, Goats, On Any Sunday the Next Chapter..to name a few. He has scored and worked on shows and video games including Loudermilk, Hannibal, American Gods, Boss, Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Watchdogs. Dave is still an in demand session player and arranger who’s credits in that side of the business include Fiona Apple, Air, Fleetwood Mac, De La Soul, Kanye West, Patty Griffin, Brandi Carlile, Shania Twain, Sharon van Etten, Mastodon, and Cordae to, once again, name but a few.\n\nThe group’s first album, recently recorded in Hollywood, will be released in the coming weeks."

She wrote the majority of her debut, At Weddings (2018), while living at home. For a while after leaving home and church, she lived in Louisville, Kentucky. She worked a day job and kept writing songs. She posted some of these songs to Bandcamp, which led to her signing a record deal with Saddle Creek. It all happened fast: Less than a year after her first live show, she performed on Jimmy Kimmel and she ended up moving to L.A. which is where she wrote Projections (2020), her EP followup to At Weddings.\n\n—\n\nLomelda is Hannah Read's musical project. In swampy, sweaty, Silsbee, TX, she first formed the band with her high school best friends. Throughout the next decade, Lomelda mad a habit out of stretching to fit new friendships and shrinking down to solo strummings. Four albums and a never-the-same live show chronicle these shifts in shape and sound.\n\nLomelda's fifth album is called Hannah. The album stretches and shrinks into many of Lomelda's different forms, from expansive \"Wonder\" and rock band \"Reach\" to meandering \"Stranger Sat By Me\" and finger picking \"It's Infinite.\" Through this range of moods, Hannah sings stories of strangers, suns, dogs, moms, brothers, favorite bands, \"oh god!\"s and big shots as well as herself, by name. She rejoices and reviles her god-given name and then flips it around to name herself Hannah once again. It is an album of confession and transformation made ultimately singable."

Amidst cathartic whole-body maneuvers, he can just as easily issue a flurry of rolls and virtuosic high velocity click-clack on the rims, or in turn growl right into the heads, or even take the party to the floor for some scrape and drag.\n\nAND\n\nLongtime globe travelling DIY-lifer LUCAS ‘GRANPA’ ABELA (fka Justice Yeldham) also pushes the boundaries and also pushes a large shard of glass into his face and against his mouth, playing it as an electroacoustic instrument, these days feeding the signal into a an array of modular chaos. Might there be blood?\n\nPLUS a couple actions from L.A zones: Percussionist TED BYRNES throwing metal around, and LAW – the duo of L.

It’s a stunning DIY comeback story, a doubling-down on avant-garde impulses that pays immediate dividends.\n\nSpontaneous composition and earnest, threadbare folk collide on Mudglimmer. It’s a marvel of influential synthesis, evoking Slint’s comfortability with ominous tension (“Mudglimmer”), Tortoise’s slinky push-pull grooves (“Filthy Sex Manuevers”), Waxahatchee’s slice-of-life Americana gems (“Flip”), elliptical funk-punk a la The Minutemen (“Forward”), minimal grunge-pop in the vein of Sebadoh (“King”) and so much more.\n\nMudglimmer, in short, rips. Faced with existential threats, The Slaps reconfigured and reenergized — finding purpose, not in reaching for a brass ring, but in becoming fully, unashamedly, their own wonderfully confounding thing.\n\n+++\n\n**hemlock** is the swamp-raised \"phone-fi” alt-folk project of multi-disciplinary creative force Carolina Chauffe and various rotating collaborators, currently anchored between Chicago, Austin, and Louisiana, but more often on the road.\n\nTheir most recent album ‘444’ – self-released in October 2024 – is a \"best of, so far\" of an ongoing song-a-day-for-a-month project, with its 12 carefully chosen tracks recaptured, rearranged, and reimagined in eager collaboration with an all-star Chicago cast.\n\nThis is means-to-an-end modern-day folk art for the open-hearted. Eager, intentionally imperfect, prolific.\n\nDoggedly DIY, Chauffe is an avid documenter, an amateur archivist, and a believer in magic, with a discography spanning hundreds of songs in half a decade, including their independently released debut full-band LP 'talk soon' (2022), and 6 months' worth of aforementioned phone-recorded song-a-day collections (2019-present), among other works.\n\nIn addition to hemlock, Carolina has toured in Merce Lemon (2023), Babehoven (2022), Fran (2023), and is a long-time member of TX band Little Mazarn.\n\nThey are a gatherer, a neighbor, and a hopeful for a free Palestine, for a free tomorrow for all. They will be a road dog for as long as they can, and make music for as long as they live."

The result of a collaboration between French musician Schvédranne and American poet Agneta Falk, this project revives the bohemian spirit of the Bay Area through a hybrid show combining poetry and sound creation.\n\n**An exceptional artistic encounter**\n\nAgneta Falk, a leading figure on the San Francisco poetry scene and widow of the famous poet Jack Hirschman, joins forces with French guitarist Schvédranne to bring to life a repertoire of texts from California's counter-culture. Their performance, enriched by the presence of Céline Frezza who provides the French translations, offers a unique immersive experience where improvised music dialogues with committed poetry.\n\n**A multi-faceted show**\n\nOn stage, the project takes on its full scope: Agneta Falk powerfully embodies the texts, while Schvédranne weaves a sonic backdrop with his guitar and computer compositions. Some of the poems are read in French, to create a different rhythm and sound.\n\nThis show pays tribute to San Francisco's poetic heritage, to feminism and to the spirit of revolt that still drives artistic creation today. It revives the voices of major poets such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Jack Hirschman, while blending them with contemporary creations.\n\n**Matt Sedillo** is the Literary Director of the Mexican Cultural Institute of Los Angeles, the Co-Founder of El Martillo Press, the host of Radio La Raza on KPFK and the author of Mowing Leaves of Grass, City on the Second Floor, and Mexican Style. His work has been translated and published in seven languages, including a full collection in Italian, Vite Derubata, Tiera Derubate, published in Itally by Edizione Ensemble and a full collection in Spanish, Our Corzanes Are Still Burning, Chicanx Sin Fronteras."

      "description": "**Video Age, Why Bonnie, Uni Boys**\n\nVideo Age make breezy and timeless songs that are so ineffable, they can only be the result of a decades-long friendship and songwriting partnership. Across four albums, Ross Farbe and Ray Micarelli have gleefully worn their influences on their sleeve, writing inviting tunes that reference sounds ranging from disco to pop and indie rock. On their latest LP, Away From The Castle, the New Orleans duo have strayed from nostalgia and instead have honed their own unique musicality, making songs that sound like themselves with a taste of inspiration from classic singer-songwriters of the 60s and 70s. The album is a testament to the possibilities that come from getting out of your comfort zone, the freedom of writing vulnerably and unselfconsciously, and the joys of getting to work with your closest companions.\n\nAfter releasing and eventually touring their critically-acclaimed third album Pleasure Line in 2020, Farbe and Micarelli sought inspiration for their next project through collaboration. They worked with Drugdealer on his album Hiding In Plain Sight, Micarelli gigged throughout New Orleans’ jazz and blues scenes, and Farbe recorded local artists at his home studio, most recently producing Esther Rose’s new album Safe to Run. Feeling refreshed, they rented a cabin in Eunice, Louisiana with touring members Nick Corson and Duncan Troast, where they spent eight days in August 2022 jamming, cooking and writing together.\n\nThrough this process, Video Age have made their best collection of tracks to date by perfectly alchemizing their influences and experiences into a record still tinged with nostalgia, but moving towards a more succinct and authentic voice. Away From The Castle is a document of a band having fun and rediscovering their love for making music together, but it’s also their most honest and personal work yet–Video Age distilled to its purest form."

Truman would form his cult farwest emo band Frat Mouse in 2019, and began to play and release music – all while producing and recording the albums in his bedroom. Over the next five years the band would release four albums and play over 300 shows, cutting their teeth at local venues and on DIY tours. Recording Frat Mouse and local LA artists in the scene led Truman to pursue the other side of his artistry, engineering and production. Now, Truman is writing and\n\nrecording more than ever.

By the early 1990s, as a generation came of age that was too young to have seen Black Flag or Minor Threat, straight edge had started to take a militant approach, drawing lines to keep out people who would not blindly follow some of the genre’s shifting ideals. Frail, a straight-edge hardcore band from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who were active from spring 1993 to fall 1995, was more focused on communicating ideas and inclusion; they wanted to teach as much as learn, and this duality meant their music was the perfect vehicle to release the tension of that new generation. Their lineup — Mike Parsell and Don Devore on guitars, Brian Berwind on drums, Derek Zglenski on bass, and Eric Hammar on vocals — released 20 songs, a discography spread across a lone demo tape and a handful of small runs of vinyl on various DIY punk labels, all long out of print."

A perverse product of the Arizona desert, Bob Log III has been diligently travelling the globe since 1996, showcasing his incomparable talents and developing a devoted following along the way. A whirlwind of dexterous limbs and digits, this super star sonic showman has to be seen to be believed.\n\nClad in his cannonball man, extra tight jumpsuit and signature motorcycle helmet with telephone/microphone attached, Bob Log III unfailingly sweats up a river while kicking on a kick drum, stomping his homemade foot cymbal and playing slide on an old archtop guitar. His endless pursuit for musical mayhem and a downright party has seen his unique talents utilized for children’s birthday parties, obscure beer barns, mammoth music festivals and everything in between.\n\nYet, beyond these mesmerizing visuals, lies the true reason for Bob Log’s international cult status and superhero adoration. It is quite simply the guitar playing - finger picked lightning, sliding up and down, stopping when it wants to, then starting again when it feels like it, all in a way that makes people move uncontrollably, smile and reel."

      "description": "**Mercury Rev, Liz Lamere**\n\nSince forming in 1989 in Buffalo, New York, Mercury Rev has made a career of boldly exploring the fringes of artistic perception, channeling colors and sounds and visions that always seem just beyond our mortal reach. The Guardian hailed the group as “a rarity in indie rock: a band who have continually evolved their sound, pushing at the boundaries of what rock music actually means over 25 years, borrowing from jazz, funk, doo-wop, techno, folk and more along the way,” while Rolling Stone praised their “majestic chaos,” and the BBC lauded their “shimmering psychedelic pop, immersive indie-rock, \\[and\\] spectacularly engrossing passages of sumptuous instrumentation.”\n\nThe band’s 1991 debut, ‘Yerself Is Steam,’ landed on Pitchfork’s Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time, and their 1998 breakthrough, ‘Deserter’s Songs’, upon its release was named NME’s Album of the Year, Pitchfork’s 100 Favorite Records of the 1990s (2003),Melody Maker’s All Time Top 100 Albums (2000), Uncut’s 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016) and multiple1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die lists. Diverse musical collaborations with legendary artistic luminaries as well as major festival and network television performances around the world have solidified their status as One of America’s most pioneering groups capable of straddling the line between mainstream appeal and progressive musical experimentation…\n\nRecorded in the Catskills, the band’s ninth album, Born Horses, is out now on Bella Union."
