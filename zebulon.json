Their third album Berserk is out March 7th.\n\nBerserk embodies the chaos of an era where nothing feels stable, where the self is both the center of its own universe and being sucked into the disorienting orbit of a hyper-connected, hyper-consumptive culture. Berserk delivers the kind of eclectic, electric energy that traverses through the plains of pop-punk, post-punk, disco-punk, and schizo-synth-punk, and bites hard and fast, all while pushing the listener to confront the gnawing absurdity of living in the world today.\n\n**MUSCLE BEACH**\n\nPlay loud fast jams. The band is an impact. An immediacy, a sting. A blunt concision, a contortion into the shape of a room. It’s quivering limbs spent to shreds at the end of a show when we check back into our bodies and recount what we made them do. It’s an intervention into a moment— the moment of a given night and the moment of today’s Los Angeles in all its ills and glory"

Now, she prepares to release a collection of demos written while watching late fall turn to winter in Upstate New York. These self-recorded sketches became a focus point during a solitary and contemplative season in her life. The EP is fittingly titled “Home Recordings” to capture the relaxed and raw nature of their creation. Anna writes of these songs: “The ‘Home Recordings EP’ is a work-in-progress collection of home-recorded winter songs. A study in simplicity, leaning into a minimal approach while embracing the quietness of a season of grief. These songs are meant to be a little rough around the edges, honest and unrefined.” The “Home Recordings” EP releases in March of 2025 and marks both the end of a season and the beginning of something so much more."

The original group – Cory Hanson (guitar, vocals), Lee Landey (bass), Evan Burrows (drums) and Daniel Martens (guitar) - recorded Ganglion Reef before too long and attracted the attentions of GOD? Records, In the Red and Drag City all at once. A deal was dreamed up and hammered down: first album with GOD?, second with In the Red, and then Drag City. What would the result of THAT be?\n\nSo began the years of furious activity; near-constant days of touring and recording and releasing. Between August 2014 and September 2017, Wand released Ganglion Reef, Golem, 1000 Days and Plum, a period in which they also reduced from quartet to trio (less Daniel) and then expanded to quintet (with the addition of Robbie Cody (guitar) and Sofia Arreguin (keys, vocals, percussion)). All this action had launched them onto the world-wide stage, which suggested increasingly more to do all the time. No prob: everyone was playing in other bands, and Cory started a solo career too. No time like the present! A maxi-EP, “Perfume”, appeared in the Spring of 2018 and the double-album Laughing Matter dropped in April 2019. Touring continued apace; it was only the CoCo craze of the following year that that forced any downtime – and even that gap was filled with the mixing of an epic live document, the 2xLP Spiders In the Rain, dropped in the pan in 2022. All this while Evan focused on his long-time other band, Behavior, plus Pink Trash Can, and Robby joined in on both endeavors, while Sofia played with Shannon Lay and Kamikaze Palm Tree, and Cory wrote and recorded two more solo albums!"

      "name": "Milly, Lottie's",
      "description": "**MILLY | Lottie's**\n\n**Lottie’s** trio evolved from the Lottie Malkmus’s solo act. Rene Garcia III, from San Francisco, plays drums and synthesizer. Adam Dieck, from Tampa, plays bass and guitar. Vocalist and songwriter Lottie Malkmus, from Portland, plays guitar and cello. Classically trained in cello, her songwriting shifted from experiments in composition to indie rock experiments.\n\n**MILLY**\n\nOriginally the solo project of Brendan Dyer, his relocation from Connecticut to Los Angeles saw the band expand to include collaborator Yarden Erez. After signing to Dangerbird Records, 2019 saw the band on tour with Swervedriver & DIIV, and in 2021 they released their acclaimed EP Wish Goes On.\n\nTo understand Eternal Ring, you have to go back to Dyer’s childhood. Learning guitar and drums from his uncle, a musician, from the age of ten, Dyer was one of the only young people in his rural Connecticut town interested in anything other than sports and other stereotypical markers of American life. Naturally, Dyer began to gravitate towards emo — the closest thing many teens have to outsider art — as an art form he could identify with, bands like Hawthorne Heights subconsciously laying the groundwork for the music he would make as an adult. “It probably only lasted a year or two that I was interested in that sort of thing, but now I feel like it’s become a thing in my life where it’s like, full circle,” he says. “When we were writing this album, and touring before writing this album, I was reconnecting with a lot of the music that I was listening to in my youth and realizing that there was a reason why I liked this music so much.”\n\nThe MILLY of Eternal Ring, though, is a vastly different project from the one Dyer began in his childhood bedroom. Where the band’s old songs were dazed and gorgeously laconic, Eternal Ring is muscular, punchy, almost alarmingly direct. You only need to hear album opener and debut single “Illuminate” to understand the change: slipping quickly from emo balladry into something heavy and intoxicatingly intense, it’s a clear marker that this is the work of a tighter, more dynamic Milly. There is no slack to these songs — even the nine-minute “Stuck In The Middle” is an impossibly taut endurance work, jumping from emotive build to gut-wrenching squall in a second."

      "description": "**Marshall Presents: Father Of Loud Night**\n\n**Featuring Gustaf, Memo PST, Slumped**\n\nEach year on “Father Of Loud Day” Marshall honors the legacy of founder Jim Marshall by encouraging musicians and music lovers to crank up their amps and celebrate the sound of rock and roll. This year, in honor of the man who started it all and helped define the sound of a generation, Marshall is throwing a party stacked with bands that are carrying on Jim’s legacy of loud. Don’t miss it.\n\n- **Gustaf** began in 2018 as a last-minute project when Lydia Gammill and friends took an empty van to SXSW. Their raw, high-energy sound quickly made waves, leading to their 2021 debut Audio Drag for Ego Slobs, praise from Beck, and tours with Idles and Sleaford Mods. Now, their second album, Package Pt. 2, refines their post-punk edge while diving deeper into themes of self-awareness and change. Produced with Erin Tonkon (Blackstar), it channels the B-52s, Talking Heads, and No Wave’s wild spirit. Packed with sharp hooks and big questions, it’s an electrifying evolution of Gustaf’s sound.\n- Formed in 2022 by longtime collaborators Orville Neeley and Chris Shaw, **Memo PST** delivers raw, no-frills Los Angeles punk. After a self-recorded demo and a handful of California shows, they hit Discount Mirrors studio (run by John Dwyer and Eric Bauer) in May 2023 to record their debut LP—12 blasts of primitive punk, with Neeley handling songwriting and Shaw on vocals. Their debut single, I Used to Be a Pretty Boy, sold out in hours via In The Red. With a stark, unapologetic aesthetic, Memo PST is pure punk for punks, backed live by Danny Clodfelter (bass) and Jackson Todd (drums). This is just the beginning.\n- California’s **Slumped** is an alternative rock band formed in 2017 as part of the burgeoning indie scene of the east Bay Area. Informed as much by the tone and engaging songwriting of bands like Third Eye Blind and Everclear as they are by more contemporary acts like Superheaven and Tony Molina, Slumped plays rock music – full stop. Driven by screaming refrigerator guitar amps and distortion pedals, thundering drums, and roaring bass, the band’s “heavy pop songs” sound like they’re 100 stories tall, both on and off record. Existing somewhere between Weezer’s Pinkerton and Thin Lizzy’s Black Rose, Slumped is the perfect soundtrack for driving very fast into the sunset while bawling your eyes out."

      "name": "Lael Neale \"Altogether Stranger\" Album Release Show & Film Premiere, Entrance",
      "description": "**Lael Neale \"Altogether Stranger\" Album Release Show & Film Premiere, Entrance**\n\nLael Neale’s minimalist drone pop draws inspiration from the Transcendentalists, the alienation of modern life, and a rich array of musical influences—ranging from Dionne Warwick and John Lennon to primitive American gospel and Spacemen 3. Her expansive new record, Altogether Stranger, due May 2, was written and recorded in the early morning quiet of Los Angeles. Clocking in at just 32 minutes, the 9-song LP covers an unexpected breadth of musical and lyrical terrain—from garage rock nursery rhymes and creation myths to Motorik dance dirges and solitary Omnichord meditations. A brilliant lyricist, Neale has a unique ability to uncover the extraordinary within the mundane, tackling themes of polarity that recur throughout her work—country vs. city, humanity vs. technology, isolation vs. society. This album is her third collaboration with producer Guy Blakeslee who helps expand the tonal palette while staying true to Neale’s commitment to the raw immediacy and hand-made intimacy of home recording.\n\nReflecting on her lo-fi, D.I.Y. ethos in her newsletter Consensual Sound, she writes:\n\n“I love doing things the wrong way. It’s so rare that we get to do that in life. Even as artists, I notice a slow and steady conformity set in as musicians become legitimate. I do it too. How else would we fit into the font, size & waveform of streaming services. I rebel in minute ways—like refusing to follow a recipe. In the end, I’m just like everyone else: I want to belong.”\n\nAltogether Stranger was conceived after three years of oscillating between rural solitude and urban chaos. Neale explains: “On returning to Los Angeles I felt like an extraterrestrial landing on a dystopian planet so I’m writing from the perspective of a being from another realm witnessing the peculiarities of humanity.” The 32 minute album finds Neale perched at the piano in a hilltop bungalow, looking down on a rare curve of Sunset Blvd. Here, in this daily ritual of writing, singing, and painting—what David Lynch referred to as “the Art Life”—she creates the space for her most adventurous work to date.\n\nThe album’s centerpiece, “Tell Me How to Be Here,” paints a stark and haunting portrait of her return to Los Angeles, transmuting a dissociative unease into a woozy, dreamlike reverie, echoing the Velvet Underground with the distant chime of “Sunday Morning” bells. Neale’s crystalline voice floats above Blakeslee’s ambient tape loops and ghostly, disintegrating Mellotron, evoking the disorientation of waking up in a world that feels so ordinary it becomes strange.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia’s idyllic countryside, Neale brought the high-lonesome sound of her home state with her when she moved to California to pursue music. After years of writing songs on guitar and playing small venues in Los Angeles, she discovered the Omnichord in 2019, which sparked a new creative direction. Working with Blakeslee, she recorded an unpolished collection of songs on a cassette 4-track, which Blakeslee sent to Sub Pop Records in March 2020. The resulting album, Acquainted With Night, struck a chord with listeners during the bizarre days of early 2021.\n\nStar Eaters Delight (2023), deepened the collaboration with Blakeslee, infusing minimalist soundscapes with a heightened electric energy. The album’s subsequent tour included sold-out shows in Los Angeles, New York City, London, and Paris, multiple trips across Europe, and a West Coast run supporting kindred spirit Weyes Blood. This marked yet another return to Los Angeles.\n\nIndeed, Los Angeles is not just the backdrop of Altogether Stranger but a lead character. The album’s accompanying film - created with Neale's faithful Sony Handycam - builds on her ongoing series of self-directed music videos and tells the story of herself as an alien in a suit of mirrors stranded on Earth. Wandering through modern-day LA she finds both absurdity and beauty in our fragile, untenable way of life.\n\n\"In the course of writing this record there was one song I could never finish. The main line was, 'I don't belong here, I am an altogether stranger.' I meant ‘stranger’ as a noun, not an adjective. Even though I abandoned the song, the lost chorus stuck with me & became the unspoken motif of the record,\" says Neale. Over the long year it took to write Altogether Stranger, she vacillated between childlike optimism and existential melancholy. While she may not have been able to reconcile these opposing states, the attempt led to an ambitious breakthrough for this singular, self-sufficient artist."

This one-of-a-kind performance blends live improvisation, breakbeats, and Szabó’s sampled licks, woven together with ambient remixes and rare archival recordings of Gábor’s voice. Expect an immersive soundscape where psych-jazz meets sample-based storytelling—a reimagining of Szabó’s legacy through a modern experimental lens. A night of deep cuts, grooves, and deep reverence. Don’t miss it."

Translated, it means “The Māori language is a window to the Māori world” and expresses Marlon’s motivation behind his first te reo Māori album. “Through the process of constructing these songs,” Marlon says, “I’ve found a means of expressing my joys, sorrows and humour in a way that feels both distinctly new yet also connects me to my tīpuna \\[ancestors\\] and my whenua \\[land, home\\].”\n\nConnection lies at the heart of Te Whare Tīwekaweka, the album’s five-year process reconnecting Marlon to family, friends and his home town of Lyttelton after a globe-trotting decade establishing his career. That sense of home-coming is expressed on the cover art by Marlon’s mum, artist Jennifer Rendall, drawn when she was pregnant with the future singer and which eerily resembles an adult Marlon. The album also signifies another step in Marlon’s journey with his ancestral tongue, his ability in the language developing as the songs accumulated in the hours spent with close friend and co-writer, rapper KOMMI.\n\nThe language unlocked both a newfound lyrical honesty and a grand sonic vision. Supported by long-time touring band The Yarra Benders, co-producer Mark Perkins (Te Whānau-ā-Apanui), the He Waka Kōtuia singers and featuring a collaboration with pop star Lorde, the album traverses Marlon’s familiar folk-country-bluegrass territory, while continuing his exploration of poppier waters and the inherent rhythms of Māori music. The result is a collection at once contemporary and timeless."

      "description": "Clikatat Ikatowi, lowercase\n\nlowercase is a post-rock slowcore band that was started by Imaad Wasif (vocals/guitar) and Brian Girgus (drums) when they were teenagers in the Southern California desert. They released numerous singles and 3 full length LP’s between 1993-2000 on the seminal labels Amphetamine Reptile and Kill Rock Stars. Initially a duo, they enlisted a third member Tiber Scheer (bass) for their final album ‘The Going Away Present’. Over the years their music has steadily garnered a cult following. The band played shows and toured with a wide range of groups including Unwound, Sebadoh, Palace Brothers, Dirty Three, Hovercraft, Red Crayola and Faith No More. They had been on hiatus since the year 2000 but reunited in January 2025 after being asked with 3 days notice to play a show with Brainiac during the evacuation from the Altadena wildfires. Known for onstage exorcisms, minimalist counterpoint, in the best tradition of progressive hardcore; the vocals, riffs and resulting sound is a contrast of extremes and transcendent emotion."
