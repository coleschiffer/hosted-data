A whirlwind of dexterous limbs and digits, this super star sonic showman has to be seen to be believed.\n\nClad in his cannonball man, extra tight jumpsuit and signature motorcycle helmet with telephone/microphone attached, Bob Log III unfailingly sweats up a river while kicking on a kick drum, stomping his homemade foot cymbal and playing slide on an old archtop guitar. His endless pursuit for musical mayhem and a downright party has seen his unique talents utilized for children’s birthday parties, obscure beer barns, mammoth music festivals and everything in between.\n\nYet, beyond these mesmerizing visuals, lies the true reason for Bob Log’s international cult status and superhero adoration. It is quite simply the guitar playing - finger picked lightning, sliding up and down, stopping when it wants to, then starting again when it feels like it, all in a way that makes people move uncontrollably, smile and reel."

The Guardian hailed the group as “a rarity in indie rock: a band who have continually evolved their sound, pushing at the boundaries of what rock music actually means over 25 years, borrowing from jazz, funk, doo-wop, techno, folk and more along the way,” while Rolling Stone praised their “majestic chaos,” and the BBC lauded their “shimmering psychedelic pop, immersive indie-rock, \\[and\\] spectacularly engrossing passages of sumptuous instrumentation.”\n\nThe band’s 1991 debut, ‘Yerself Is Steam,’ landed on Pitchfork’s Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time, and their 1998 breakthrough, ‘Deserter’s Songs’, upon its release was named NME’s Album of the Year, Pitchfork’s 100 Favorite Records of the 1990s (2003),Melody Maker’s All Time Top 100 Albums (2000), Uncut’s 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016) and multiple1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die lists. Diverse musical collaborations with legendary artistic luminaries as well as major festival and network television performances around the world have solidified their status as One of America’s most pioneering groups capable of straddling the line between mainstream appeal and progressive musical experimentation…\n\nRecorded in the Catskills, the band’s ninth album, Born Horses, is out now on Bella Union."

Informed by the rhythms and textures of hip-hop and funk while remaining rooted in jazz, James Brandon Lewis Trio’s Apple Cores was recorded with **Chad Taylor** (drums/mbira) and **Josh Werner** (bass/guitar). The recording was a collective compositional process that happened over the course of two intense, entirely improvised sessions.\n\n“If you don’t spend time with your band, you’re not going to really trust that moment,” Lewis says. “I think we’ve spent enough time together to where we can do that. I’ve been playing Chad for like 10 years, so that’s like water right there and me and Josh have been playing together since like 2018.”\n\nThe album takes its name and intention from the column that poet and jazz theorist Amiri Baraka wrote for DownBeat in the 1960s. “I was first exposed to Amiri Baraka at Howard University \\[also Baraka’s alma mater\\],” says Lewis. “Blues People \\[Baraka’s groundbreaking 1963 study of Black American music\\], was required reading. I’m always in constant dialogue with his work.”\n\nIn addition to Baraka, the influence of another jazz giant looms mightily over Apple Cores: trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist, Don Cherry. In a testament to Cherry’s influence over the music that the trio is playing, Lewis designed each song title as a cryptogram of sorts, making subtle references to Cherry’s life and music."

Based in Northern California, the Hips headed to New Mexico, spending time at Ghost Ranch before settling in at Jono Manson's Kitchen Sink studio in Sante Fe in late 2021 for the sessions. Self-produced, When We Disappear features nine new tracks co-written by co-founders Tim Bluhm and Greg Loiacono — a collection of lit-psych rock songs Inspired by psychology and literature — as well as a raw, garagey cover of Buffy St. Marie’s 1964 addiction song “Codine.”\n\nHailed by the San Francisco Chronicle as “one of the Bay Area’s most beloved live outfits,” The Mother Hips' headline and festival performances have became the stuff of legend, finding them sharing stages with everyone from Johnny Cash and Wilco to Lucinda Williams and The Black Crowes. Rolling Stone called the band “divinely inspired,” while Pitchfork praised their “rootsy mix of 70’s rock and power pop,” and The New Yorker lauded their ability to “sing it sweet and play it dirty.”"

      "description": "**Sagittaire & Ascetic Faces, Hirons, Delanova**\n\nThe term “collision music” is typically associated with bassist/producer Bill Laswell, known for uniting artists from divergent sound worlds to create something unexpected. Coventry Suite Pt. 1, the experimental hip-hop and R&B project from Sagitairre’s Ivan Mairesse, is directly influenced by Laswell’s concept — “colliding” musicians from various communities in his hometown of LA to form the genre-agnostic group, Ascetic Faces. The album’s title is an additional nod to Coventry, the British town that spawned ska group The Specials and the multiracial 2-Tone movement.\n\n“I was interested early on in the recontextualization aspect of sampling, whether that came from Christian Marclay or Prince Paul,” explains Mairesse. “Marrying sounds or techniques from culturally distant spheres is a way of calling into question listeners' tendencies to keep these worlds separate. There is a certain political critique communicated in those juxtapositions. In a way, it’s an extension of pop-art.”"

Your fifth-favorite-band’s fifth-favorite-band are hardened road warriors and goblins of their basement studio.\n\nVirile and award-winning like a show horse, The Macks deliver a sonic-f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g-circus and they are turning heads around the country and internationally through the airwaves and their touring roadshow.\n\nWith their latest LP release, \"The Macks are a Knife,\" (via Devil Duck Records) The Macks have released their most poised and pungent LP as a result of their think-tank approach to producing records. Some legendary appearances at Pickathon, Treefort Fest, SXSW, Elsewhere Festival, and Lose Yr Mind have seen The Macks emerge from the PNW scene as a true 1 of 1 type band. With a lineup that has the group firing on all cylinders, both live and in the studio, The Macks have folks tuning in and spelling it right.\n\n**Sluttony** is a four-piece all femme rock band from Santa Cruz, CA. Formed in 2021, Sluttony quickly gained local following and re-ignited the college music scene in Santa Cruz. Their on-stage chemistry and charisma combined with the femme-rock energy of their performances quickly made Sluttony a cornerstone of the Santa Cruz house show scene, and they went on to sell out venues in town including Urbani's Cellar and The Catalyst Atrium. In March 2022, the band released their long awaited debut single \"Everybody's Business\", followed by their debut EP \"Another Something Nice\", through which they continued to explore their sound.\n\nBeyond Santa Cruz, the band has played numerous shows in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, playing a sold out show at The Smell - one of LA's notable DIY venues. In May 2023, Sluttony made their debut festival appearance at Shabang Music Festival.\n\nIn September 2023, the band relocated to Los Angeles. Their debut LP, produced by Jim Wirt, is set to be released in Winter 2025.\n\nThe band consists of Hannah Goodwin (lead vocals/guitar), Nina Maravic (guitar/vocals), Sabine Hovnanian (drums/vocals), and Caroline Margolis (bass)."

      "description": "Iceage, Dutch Interior\n\n“Shake The Feeling” is open to interpretation. The phrase can refer to the Rock ‘n’ Roll clarion call of “shaking of some action.” Or it can be taken as a callback to the even more primal urge to “shake what your mama gave you.” Ultimately, the phrase can be seen as an expression of existentialism; an acknowledgement of our consigned inability to be free of the human condition. It’s the latter interpretation, the usage that–while ostensibly romantic–implies something inescapable, that Iceage are using for the title of their new record. As with everything Iceage does, it’s a come-on delivered as a threat, a sexy invitation to get irretrievably lost.\n\nWhile not as anachronistic as a B-sides album, an outtakes compilation is something older, classic rock bands, like Deep Purple or Pavement, have. Nobody saw this for Iceage. Hell, nobody saw Iceage surviving their first US tour, let alone living long enough as a band to have songs they actually left off of records. But Iceage haven’t just survived - they managed to get better, so much so that even their wretched castoffs shine in god’s light like golden teeth from a pirate’s sun bleached skull. Even as teens, the spirit was indeed in them, and it was a spirit of both epistemological violence and euphoric grace. When lead singer Elias Bender Rønnenfelt looked dead-eyed and stalwart out across those crowds and sang the chorus of “Total Drench,” he was speaking both truth and prophecy.\n\nAs with all of Iceage’s albums, whether it be the sensual daring-do of their dark-hardcore masterpiece debut, the Flying Nun-dappled “Oi!!!!” of You’re Nothing, the shift to cowpunk gothic romanticism on Plowing Into the Field of Love, or the space truckin’ gospel-rock of their most recent albums, Elias Bender Rønnenfelt, Johan Suurballe Wieth, Jakob Tvilling Pless and Dan Kjær Nielsen make the impossible seem effortless. Shake The Feeling: Outtakes & Rarities 2015-2021, the band’s second full length for Mexican Summer, is a collection of non-LP cuts (or “misfit children,” as Elias describes them) from the seven years during which Iceage made Plowing Into the Field of Love (2014), Beyondless (2018), and Seek Shelter (2021)."

      "description": "**re:VOLT, Skyler King**\n\n**re:VOLT is the ongoing collaboration of Jill Fraser, Peter Grenader and Thomas Klepper.**\n\n**Jill Fraser** is a composer and electronic music pioneer with a career spanning over 40 years, creating music for films, commercials, games, and, as she puts it, \"in the wild\" as entertainment. Her deep and ever-evolving curiosity about music as both a scientific and spiritual force comes to life in her forthcoming album, Earthly Pleasures. This project reimagines American revival hymns from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, using early Serge systems alongside modern tools like the Ableton Push 3. More than just creating expressive, personal music, Jill's work contemplates themes of death and the afterlife while considering how today's sources of meaning might be understood by future generations and technologies yet to come.\n\nJill Fraser set her sights on this creative path early in her career. Mentored by Morton Subotnick and studying with luminaries like Mel Powell and Earle Brown at CalArts, she also attended master classes with influential figures such as John Cage and Lou Harrison. These experiences, combined with her own artistic instincts, shaped her into an expansive and open-eared composer. Her work at Serge Modular in Hollywood further honed her visionary approach to music. In the 1980s, Jill brought modular synthesizers into Hollywood studios to score films, marking a new direction in film composition. Her credits include Personal Best and Cruising (both in collaboration with Jack Nitzsche), as well as \\*Hardcore\\* (directed by Paul Schrader). During this time, she was also active in the vibrant Los Angeles punk and spoken word scene, touring with singer Buffy Sainte-Marie and performance artist Ivan E. Roth. She performed modular synth sets opening for acts like The Minutemen and Henry Rollins, and in 1988, released the CD \\*Alphabetical Disorders\\* with Ivan on the electronic label Periodic Music.\n\nThroughout her career, Jill Fraser has composed both electronic and acoustic music for hundreds of TV commercials, working with major brands like Lexus, BMW, Honda, Porsche, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Mattel, Carl’s Jr., NBC, Apple, Adidas, Estee Lauder, Baskin Robbins, Yamaha Motorcycles, and many others. She has won three Clio Awards for original music and is a voting member of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2018, she wrote and performed music with the Zzyzx Society. Currently, Jill performs live with re:VOLT and her new album Earthly Pleasures is available on Drag City Records.\n\n**Peter Grenader** has an enduring history in electronic music. Studying composition at CalArts under Morton Subotnick, his works have been performed across the United States and Europe. His discography includes Secret Life (2013) on Coda Recordings, zZyzx Society with Jill Fraser, featuring Danny Carey, Chas Smith, and Thighpaulsandra (2018) on ZSR Records, Patch CV Two (2018) on Organic Records, Tool’s Fear Inoculum (2019) on RCA Records, and two albums with POV featuring Steve Roach, Theo Travis, Thighpaulsandra, Martin Shellard (2019/2020) distributed by Roach’s Timeroom Records.\n\nHe was a featured composer at the 17th American Composer’s Forum Salon in Venice. His Electrolux earned recognition by winning the Periòdic Music Festival in Barcelona, Spain. His work has also been showcased at numerous other festivals, including the SEAMUS National Conference, the University of North Texas, CalArts, Stony Brook University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Texas at Austin, Georgia State University's Pulse Field, the Florida Electro-Acoustic Music Festival, the 2003 Electric Rainbow Coalition Festival at Dartmouth, the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht, Holland, two wins at the Virginia Commonwealth University Music Festival, and three performances at the Los Angeles Sonic Odyssey.\n\nCollaborations with fellow creatives include Analoglive! along with film composer Gary Chang, Nine Inch Nails keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, Richard Devine, composer and instrument designer Chas Smith, Thighpaulsandra (of Coil and Spiritualized) and video artist Paul Tzanetopoulos at the Redcat Theater in Los Angeles. Other notable collaborations include zZyzx Society, The Third Ear, POV featuring Steve Roach, and several performances with re:VOLT at The Lab in San Fransisco, The Philosophical Research Society and 2220 Arts + Archives in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was featured on David Elliot’s 2018 synthesis documentary series Patch CV: Controlling Voltage. For the past 13 years he has served as the instrument and sound designer for the progressive metal band Tool and earned an RIAA gold record for his work on their album Fear Inoculum. A past member of the SEAMUS board of directors, he is the founder and primary designer for Electro-Acoustic Research (EAR) and Plan B Synthesizers.\n\n**Thomas Klepper** is a Los Angeles based sitarist and student of Etawah Gharana with renoun sitar master Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan, DJ, soundbath artist, producer and electronic musician who has released records under the aliases Romeo, LoTom, Rinpoche and Thomas K for the Association of Masks label. He has performed at Burning Man, the Disclosure Festival, Music For Dancers and The Higley Center for the Performing Arts among others.\n\nHe is the host of the Library of Sounds show for Dublab Radio and aims to create thought-provoking music that is rooted in tradition while at the same time paving the way into the future.\n\nhttp://www.re-volt.world"

Releasing a myriad of limited cassettes, VHS films, and – by now – highly sought-after records.\n\n\"Ak'chamel's deliberately lo-fi, murky temple music conjures not only the post-industrial rituals lusting for the pagan days of Druidic Britain but also the pantheistic, impishly playful rhythms from Thai temple music as well as some choice nods to the occult ethnomusicology of their professed influences, The Sun City Girls.\" –aQuarius RecOrds\n\nMojave dweller Derek Monypeny sees his musical mission as adding to and expanding on what he calls the \"desert continuum;\" the psychedelic sirocco swirl of desert-based stringed instruments played with utter abandon by musicians the world over."

      "description": "**OVLOV**\n\nSince 2009, Ovlov’s transmissions have been sporadic, but they’ve always been impactful. The band’s early run of EPs established the Connecticut four-piece as a modern update on a certain strain of northeastern indie-rock. By the time the band’s debut album Am was released in 2013, Ovlov was getting comparisons to Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh tossed in their direction, and while those elements were certainly present in their sound, Ovlov always let catchy pop hooks slip into the mix too. On their third album, Buds, those pop elements are more pronounced than they’ve ever been before.\n\n“I would like to think that the songs on this album are all pop songs at the core,” says Steve Hartlett, the band’s songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist. On first blush, Buds won’t shock longtime Ovlov fans, but on repeat listens, those fuzzy, crushing guitars start to feel less like the central focus and more of a delivery system for Hartlett’s grander ambitions. “For the past few years, the number of rock bands I’ve been listening to has grown smaller and smaller,” says Hartlett. “Unfortunately, it’s the only genre and style I’ve ever really felt comfortable writing. That’s probably mostly because I write everything on a guitar. Don’t get me wrong, I love rock music—there’s nothing more satisfying than playing an E chord through a Big muff as loud as the amp will go—I just want to slowly progress into writing the most perfectly poppy of pop songs.”\n\nRecorded with the same producer and engineer who has handled every Ovlov album, Michael John Thomas III at his Black Lodge Studio in Brooklyn, Buds is the latest document of Ovlov’s slow and sturdy evolution. But this time, the band’s become even more of a family affair. Though Steve’s long been riffing alongside guitarist Morgan Luzzi, the band was started with Steve’s younger brother Theo on drums. This time around, their older brother Jon joined them on bass—and their dad, Ted, even stops in to rip a sax solo on “Cheer Up, Chihiro!” Considering the Hartlett brothers learned how to play music together, it’s a full circle moment as they all come together in service of making Ovlov’s most fully realized statement yet."

      "description": "**Rickshaw Billie's Burger Patrol, Here Lies Man**\n\n“Our catalog has never been short on big dumb riffs, but the idea on this record was to really turn the screw,” says RBBP bassist Aaron Metzdorf. On Big Dumb Riffs, that screw is cranked incredibly tight.\n\n“We just wanted ‘the part’: The opening of Pantera’s ‘Primal Concrete Sledge’, the breakdown in Primus’ ‘Pudding Time’ — the shit that makes you move and lose your mind. Just that part the whole time.”\n\nAcross 11 concise, taut songs — most clocking in around 2 minutes or less — Rickshaw Billie’s Burger Patrol demonstrates their skillful ability to blend the merciless low end of Leo Lydon’s 8-string guitar, Aaron Metzdorf’s masterful chordwork on the bass, and Sean St.Germain’s driving drumming.\n\nHot on the heels of their breakout 5th studio release Doom Wop (2023), Rickshaw Billie’s Burger Patrol returns with Big Dumb Riffs: A whole new variant of the fuzzed out, overdriven, melodic, groovy music they have been making since 2016. While Big Dumb Riffs is decidedly more aggressive and rhythmic, it still retains the overtly melodic feel of Doom Wop. But Leo Lydon’s vocals are considerably more angry and negative (song titles like “1-800-EAT-SHIT” and “Body Bag” should be a clue.)\n\n“The whole writing process was, ‘what if we just played two notes the whole song’,” Metzdorf says. “‘What if we tuned down to almost unusable string tension?’, ‘what if we write a record that will make everyone say ‘wow that is dumb’? Leo and I really move around on stage a lot. Being a dingus is crucial to the groove. All these riffs were designed to allow us to act bigger and dumber on stage.”\n\nBig Dumb Riffs will be available for streaming and download on March 22, 2024. LP to follow in late Spring."

      "description": "**Astrid Sonne**\n\nAstrid Sonne is a Danish, London-based composer and viola player. Throughout her acclaimed discography, Astrid Sonne has been carefully crafting different moods through electronic and acoustic instrumental endeavours. On her most recent album “Great Doubt” (January 2024) this skill is refined, now with the distinct addition of the composer's own vocal in the fore. The tone of each track is unmistakably Sonne’s, structured around contrasts through an impeccable sense of timing. Lyrics on the album are sparse, merely highlighting different scenes or emotional states of being, leaving the music to fill in the blanks. Yet they also form a pattern of ambiguity, consolidated through the album title, searching for answers through looking at how and what you are asking, questions for the world, questions of love. The viola, a trusted companion since Astrid Sonne’s youth, appears effortlessly throughout the album, fully integrated into the sonic universe; through a pizzicato driven arrangement in the poignant track “Almost” or along with booms and claps in mutated cinematic stabs during “Give my all”, paraphrasing Mariah Carey's 1997 ballad. Yet the string section also gives way to explorations of woodwinds, counterbalancing the bowed movements with digital brass and airy flutes. Finally, beats and detuned piano are fresh additions to the soundscape, cementing how Sonne’s practice is always evolving into new territories."
