She wrote the majority of her debut, At Weddings (2018), while living at home. For a while after leaving home and church, she lived in Louisville, Kentucky. She worked a day job and kept writing songs. She posted some of these songs to Bandcamp, which led to her signing a record deal with Saddle Creek. It all happened fast: Less than a year after her first live show, she performed on Jimmy Kimmel and she ended up moving to L.A. which is where she wrote Projections (2020), her EP followup to At Weddings.\n\n‚Äî\n\nLomelda is Hannah Read's musical project. In swampy, sweaty, Silsbee, TX, she first formed the band with her high school best friends. Throughout the next decade, Lomelda mad a habit out of stretching to fit new friendships and shrinking down to solo strummings. Four albums and a never-the-same live show chronicle these shifts in shape and sound.\n\nLomelda's fifth album is called Hannah. The album stretches and shrinks into many of Lomelda's different forms, from expansive \"Wonder\" and rock band \"Reach\" to meandering \"Stranger Sat By Me\" and finger picking \"It's Infinite.\" Through this range of moods, Hannah sings stories of strangers, suns, dogs, moms, brothers, favorite bands, \"oh god!\"s and big shots as well as herself, by name. She rejoices and reviles her god-given name and then flips it around to name herself Hannah once again. It is an album of confession and transformation made ultimately singable."

It‚Äôs a stunning DIY comeback story, a doubling-down on avant-garde impulses that pays immediate dividends.\n\nSpontaneous composition and earnest, threadbare folk collide on Mudglimmer. It‚Äôs a marvel of influential synthesis, evoking Slint‚Äôs comfortability with ominous tension (‚ÄúMudglimmer‚Äù), Tortoise‚Äôs slinky push-pull grooves (‚ÄúFilthy Sex Manuevers‚Äù), Waxahatchee‚Äôs slice-of-life Americana gems (‚ÄúFlip‚Äù), elliptical funk-punk a la The Minutemen (‚ÄúForward‚Äù), minimal grunge-pop in the vein of Sebadoh (‚ÄúKing‚Äù) and so much more.\n\nMudglimmer, in short, rips. Faced with existential threats, The Slaps reconfigured and reenergized ‚Äî finding purpose, not in reaching for a brass ring, but in becoming fully, unashamedly, their own wonderfully confounding thing.\n\n+++\n\n**hemlock** is the swamp-raised \"phone-fi‚Äù alt-folk project of multi-disciplinary creative force Carolina Chauffe and various rotating collaborators, currently anchored between Chicago, Austin, and Louisiana, but more often on the road.\n\nTheir most recent album ‚Äò444‚Äô ‚Äì self-released in October 2024 ‚Äì is a \"best of, so far\" of an ongoing song-a-day-for-a-month project, with its 12 carefully chosen tracks recaptured, rearranged, and reimagined in eager collaboration with an all-star Chicago cast.\n\nThis is means-to-an-end modern-day folk art for the open-hearted. Eager, intentionally imperfect, prolific.\n\nDoggedly DIY, Chauffe is an avid documenter, an amateur archivist, and a believer in magic, with a discography spanning hundreds of songs in half a decade, including their independently released debut full-band LP 'talk soon' (2022), and 6 months' worth of aforementioned phone-recorded song-a-day collections (2019-present), among other works.\n\nIn addition to hemlock, Carolina has toured in Merce Lemon (2023), Babehoven (2022), Fran (2023), and is a long-time member of TX band Little Mazarn.\n\nThey are a gatherer, a neighbor, and a hopeful for a free Palestine, for a free tomorrow for all. They will be a road dog for as long as they can, and make music for as long as they live."

The result of a collaboration between French musician Schv√©dranne and American poet Agneta Falk, this project revives the bohemian spirit of the Bay Area through a hybrid show combining poetry and sound creation.\n\n**An exceptional artistic encounter**\n\nAgneta Falk, a leading figure on the San Francisco poetry scene and widow of the famous poet Jack Hirschman, joins forces with French guitarist Schv√©dranne to bring to life a repertoire of texts from California's counter-culture. Their performance, enriched by the presence of C√©line Frezza who provides the French translations, offers a unique immersive experience where improvised music dialogues with committed poetry.\n\n**A multi-faceted show**\n\nOn stage, the project takes on its full scope: Agneta Falk powerfully embodies the texts, while Schv√©dranne weaves a sonic backdrop with his guitar and computer compositions. Some of the poems are read in French, to create a different rhythm and sound.\n\nThis show pays tribute to San Francisco's poetic heritage, to feminism and to the spirit of revolt that still drives artistic creation today. It revives the voices of major poets such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Jack Hirschman, while blending them with contemporary creations.\n\n**Matt Sedillo** is the Literary Director of the Mexican Cultural Institute of Los Angeles, the Co-Founder of El Martillo Press, the host of Radio La Raza on KPFK and the author of Mowing Leaves of Grass, City on the Second Floor, and Mexican Style. His work has been translated and published in seven languages, including a full collection in Italian, Vite Derubata, Tiera Derubate, published in Itally by Edizione Ensemble and a full collection in Spanish, Our Corzanes Are Still Burning, Chicanx Sin Fronteras."

      "description": "**Video Age, Why Bonnie, Uni Boys**\n\nVideo Age make breezy and timeless songs that are so ineffable, they can only be the result of a decades-long friendship and songwriting partnership. Across four albums, Ross Farbe and Ray Micarelli have gleefully worn their influences on their sleeve, writing inviting tunes that reference sounds ranging from disco to pop and indie rock. On their latest LP, Away From The Castle, the New Orleans duo have strayed from nostalgia and instead have honed their own unique musicality, making songs that sound like themselves with a taste of inspiration from classic singer-songwriters of the 60s and 70s. The album is a testament to the possibilities that come from getting out of your comfort zone, the freedom of writing vulnerably and unselfconsciously, and the joys of getting to work with your closest companions.\n\nAfter releasing and eventually touring their critically-acclaimed third album Pleasure Line in 2020, Farbe and Micarelli sought inspiration for their next project through collaboration. They worked with Drugdealer on his album Hiding In Plain Sight, Micarelli gigged throughout New Orleans‚Äô jazz and blues scenes, and Farbe recorded local artists at his home studio, most recently producing Esther Rose‚Äôs new album Safe to Run. Feeling refreshed, they rented a cabin in Eunice, Louisiana with touring members Nick Corson and Duncan Troast, where they spent eight days in August 2022 jamming, cooking and writing together.\n\nThrough this process, Video Age have made their best collection of tracks to date by perfectly alchemizing their influences and experiences into a record still tinged with nostalgia, but moving towards a more succinct and authentic voice. Away From The Castle is a document of a band having fun and rediscovering their love for making music together, but it‚Äôs also their most honest and personal work yet‚ÄìVideo Age distilled to its purest form."

At 14, Truman moved to Los Angeles, where he fell in love with folk music and songwriting all while continuing to pursue his love of emo. Truman would form his cult farwest emo band Frat Mouse in 2019, and began to play and release music ‚Äì all while producing and recording the albums in his bedroom. Over the next five years the band would release four albums and play over 300 shows, cutting their teeth at local venues and on DIY tours. Recording Frat Mouse and local LA artists in the scene led Truman to pursue the other side of his artistry, engineering and production. Now, Truman is writing and\n\nrecording more than ever. His homemade debut album ‚ÄúAmerican Recordings‚Äù will be out in February 2025."

By the early 1990s, as a generation came of age that was too young to have seen Black Flag or Minor Threat, straight edge had started to take a militant approach, drawing lines to keep out people who would not blindly follow some of the genre‚Äôs shifting ideals. Frail, a straight-edge hardcore band from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who were active from spring 1993 to fall 1995, was more focused on communicating ideas and inclusion; they wanted to teach as much as learn, and this duality meant their music was the perfect vehicle to release the tension of that new generation. Their lineup ‚Äî Mike Parsell and Don Devore on guitars, Brian Berwind on drums, Derek Zglenski on bass, and Eric Hammar on vocals ‚Äî released 20 songs, a discography spread across a lone demo tape and a handful of small runs of vinyl on various DIY punk labels, all long out of print."

Informed by the rhythms and textures of hip-hop and funk while remaining rooted in jazz, James Brandon Lewis Trio‚Äôs Apple Cores was recorded with Chad Taylor (drums/mbira) and Josh Werner (bass/guitar). The recording was a collective compositional process that happened over the course of two intense, entirely improvised sessions.\n\n‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt spend time with your band, you‚Äôre not going to really trust that moment,‚Äù Lewis says. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve spent enough time together to where we can do that. I‚Äôve been playing Chad for like 10 years, so that‚Äôs like water right there and me and Josh have been playing together since like 2018.‚Äù\n\nThe album takes its name and intention from the column that poet and jazz theorist Amiri Baraka wrote for DownBeat in the 1960s. ‚ÄúI was first exposed to Amiri Baraka at Howard University \\[also Baraka‚Äôs alma mater\\],‚Äù says Lewis. ‚ÄúBlues People \\[Baraka‚Äôs groundbreaking 1963 study of Black American music\\], was required reading. I‚Äôm always in constant dialogue with his work.‚Äù\n\nIn addition to Baraka, the influence of another jazz giant looms mightily over Apple Cores: trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist, Don Cherry. In a testament to Cherry‚Äôs influence over the music that the trio is playing, Lewis designed each song title as a cryptogram of sorts, making subtle references to Cherry‚Äôs life and music."

      "description": "**Sagittaire & Ascetic Faces, Hirons, Cole Berliner**\n\nThe term ‚Äúcollision music‚Äù is typically associated with bassist/producer Bill Laswell, known for uniting artists from divergent sound worlds to create something unexpected. Coventry Suite Pt. 1, the experimental hip-hop and R&B project from Sagitairre‚Äôs Ivan Mairesse, is directly influenced by Laswell‚Äôs concept ‚Äî ‚Äúcolliding‚Äù musicians from various communities in his hometown of LA to form the genre-agnostic group, Ascetic Faces. The album‚Äôs title is an additional nod to Coventry, the British town that spawned ska group The Specials and the multiracial 2-Tone movement.\n\n‚ÄúI was interested early on in the recontextualization aspect of sampling, whether that came from Christian Marclay or Prince Paul,‚Äù explains Mairesse. ‚ÄúMarrying sounds or techniques from culturally distant spheres is a way of calling into question listeners' tendencies to keep these worlds separate. There is a certain political critique communicated in those juxtapositions. In a way, it‚Äôs an extension of pop-art.‚Äù"
