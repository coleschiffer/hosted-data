      "description": "**Protest Poetry and Electronic Music: Agneta Falk and Matt Sédillo**\n\n**A poetic encounter between San Francisco and France**\n\nWhen San Francisco's protest poetry meets French music, a unique and powerful work is born. The result of a collaboration between French musician Schvédranne and American poet Agneta Falk, this project revives the bohemian spirit of the Bay Area through a hybrid show combining poetry and sound creation.\n\n**An exceptional artistic encounter**\n\nAgneta Falk, a leading figure on the San Francisco poetry scene and widow of the famous poet Jack Hirschman, joins forces with French guitarist Schvédranne to bring to life a repertoire of texts from California's counter-culture. Their performance, enriched by the presence of Céline Frezza who provides the French translations, offers a unique immersive experience where improvised music dialogues with committed poetry.\n\n**A multi-faceted show**\n\nOn stage, the project takes on its full scope: Agneta Falk powerfully embodies the texts, while Schvédranne weaves a sonic backdrop with his guitar and computer compositions. Some of the poems are read in French, to create a different rhythm and sound.\n\nThis show pays tribute to San Francisco's poetic heritage, to feminism and to the spirit of revolt that still drives artistic creation today. It revives the voices of major poets such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Jack Hirschman, while blending them with contemporary creations.\n\n**Matt Sedillo** is the Literary Director of the Mexican Cultural Institute of Los Angeles, the Co-Founder of El Martillo Press, the host of Radio La Raza on KPFK and the author of Mowing Leaves of Grass, City on the Second Floor, and Mexican Style. His work has been translated and published in seven languages, including a full collection in Italian, Vite Derubata, Tiera Derubate, published in Itally by Edizione Ensemble and a full collection in Spanish, Our Corzanes Are Still Burning, Chicanx Sin Fronteras."

      "description": "**Video Age, Why Bonnie, Uni Boys**\n\nVideo Age make breezy and timeless songs that are so ineffable, they can only be the result of a decades-long friendship and songwriting partnership. Across four albums, Ross Farbe and Ray Micarelli have gleefully worn their influences on their sleeve, writing inviting tunes that reference sounds ranging from disco to pop and indie rock. On their latest LP, Away From The Castle, the New Orleans duo have strayed from nostalgia and instead have honed their own unique musicality, making songs that sound like themselves with a taste of inspiration from classic singer-songwriters of the 60s and 70s. The album is a testament to the possibilities that come from getting out of your comfort zone, the freedom of writing vulnerably and unselfconsciously, and the joys of getting to work with your closest companions.\n\nAfter releasing and eventually touring their critically-acclaimed third album Pleasure Line in 2020, Farbe and Micarelli sought inspiration for their next project through collaboration. They worked with Drugdealer on his album Hiding In Plain Sight, Micarelli gigged throughout New Orleans’ jazz and blues scenes, and Farbe recorded local artists at his home studio, most recently producing Esther Rose’s new album Safe to Run. Feeling refreshed, they rented a cabin in Eunice, Louisiana with touring members Nick Corson and Duncan Troast, where they spent eight days in August 2022 jamming, cooking and writing together.\n\nThrough this process, Video Age have made their best collection of tracks to date by perfectly alchemizing their influences and experiences into a record still tinged with nostalgia, but moving towards a more succinct and authentic voice. Away From The Castle is a document of a band having fun and rediscovering their love for making music together, but it’s also their most honest and personal work yet–Video Age distilled to its purest form."

At 14, Truman moved to Los Angeles, where he fell in love with folk music and songwriting all while continuing to pursue his love of emo. Truman would form his cult farwest emo band Frat Mouse in 2019, and began to play and release music – all while producing and recording the albums in his bedroom. Over the next five years the band would release four albums and play over 300 shows, cutting their teeth at local venues and on DIY tours. Recording Frat Mouse and local LA artists in the scene led Truman to pursue the other side of his artistry, engineering and production. Now, Truman is writing and\n\nrecording more than ever. His homemade debut album “American Recordings” will be out in February 2025."

By the early 1990s, as a generation came of age that was too young to have seen Black Flag or Minor Threat, straight edge had started to take a militant approach, drawing lines to keep out people who would not blindly follow some of the genre’s shifting ideals. Frail, a straight-edge hardcore band from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who were active from spring 1993 to fall 1995, was more focused on communicating ideas and inclusion; they wanted to teach as much as learn, and this duality meant their music was the perfect vehicle to release the tension of that new generation. Their lineup — Mike Parsell and Don Devore on guitars, Brian Berwind on drums, Derek Zglenski on bass, and Eric Hammar on vocals — released 20 songs, a discography spread across a lone demo tape and a handful of small runs of vinyl on various DIY punk labels, all long out of print."

A whirlwind of dexterous limbs and digits, this super star sonic showman has to be seen to be believed.\n\nClad in his cannonball man, extra tight jumpsuit and signature motorcycle helmet with telephone/microphone attached, Bob Log III unfailingly sweats up a river while kicking on a kick drum, stomping his homemade foot cymbal and playing slide on an old archtop guitar. His endless pursuit for musical mayhem and a downright party has seen his unique talents utilized for children’s birthday parties, obscure beer barns, mammoth music festivals and everything in between.\n\nYet, beyond these mesmerizing visuals, lies the true reason for Bob Log’s international cult status and superhero adoration. It is quite simply the guitar playing - finger picked lightning, sliding up and down, stopping when it wants to, then starting again when it feels like it, all in a way that makes people move uncontrollably, smile and reel."

The Guardian hailed the group as “a rarity in indie rock: a band who have continually evolved their sound, pushing at the boundaries of what rock music actually means over 25 years, borrowing from jazz, funk, doo-wop, techno, folk and more along the way,” while Rolling Stone praised their “majestic chaos,” and the BBC lauded their “shimmering psychedelic pop, immersive indie-rock, \\[and\\] spectacularly engrossing passages of sumptuous instrumentation.”\n\nThe band’s 1991 debut, ‘Yerself Is Steam,’ landed on Pitchfork’s Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time, and their 1998 breakthrough, ‘Deserter’s Songs’, upon its release was named NME’s Album of the Year, Pitchfork’s 100 Favorite Records of the 1990s (2003),Melody Maker’s All Time Top 100 Albums (2000), Uncut’s 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016) and multiple1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die lists. Diverse musical collaborations with legendary artistic luminaries as well as major festival and network television performances around the world have solidified their status as One of America’s most pioneering groups capable of straddling the line between mainstream appeal and progressive musical experimentation…\n\nRecorded in the Catskills, the band’s ninth album, Born Horses, is out now on Bella Union."

Informed by the rhythms and textures of hip-hop and funk while remaining rooted in jazz, James Brandon Lewis Trio’s Apple Cores was recorded with Chad Taylor (drums/mbira) and Josh Werner (bass/guitar). The recording was a collective compositional process that happened over the course of two intense, entirely improvised sessions.\n\n“If you don’t spend time with your band, you’re not going to really trust that moment,” Lewis says. “I think we’ve spent enough time together to where we can do that. I’ve been playing Chad for like 10 years, so that’s like water right there and me and Josh have been playing together since like 2018.”\n\nThe album takes its name and intention from the column that poet and jazz theorist Amiri Baraka wrote for DownBeat in the 1960s. “I was first exposed to Amiri Baraka at Howard University \\[also Baraka’s alma mater\\],” says Lewis. “Blues People \\[Baraka’s groundbreaking 1963 study of Black American music\\], was required reading. I’m always in constant dialogue with his work.”\n\nIn addition to Baraka, the influence of another jazz giant looms mightily over Apple Cores: trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist, Don Cherry. In a testament to Cherry’s influence over the music that the trio is playing, Lewis designed each song title as a cryptogram of sorts, making subtle references to Cherry’s life and music."

Based in Northern California, the Hips headed to New Mexico, spending time at Ghost Ranch before settling in at Jono Manson's Kitchen Sink studio in Sante Fe in late 2021 for the sessions. Self-produced, When We Disappear features nine new tracks co-written by co-founders Tim Bluhm and Greg Loiacono — a collection of lit-psych rock songs Inspired by psychology and literature — as well as a raw, garagey cover of Buffy St. Marie’s 1964 addiction song “Codine.”\n\nHailed by the San Francisco Chronicle as “one of the Bay Area’s most beloved live outfits,” The Mother Hips' headline and festival performances have became the stuff of legend, finding them sharing stages with everyone from Johnny Cash and Wilco to Lucinda Williams and The Black Crowes. Rolling Stone called the band “divinely inspired,” while Pitchfork praised their “rootsy mix of 70’s rock and power pop,” and The New Yorker lauded their ability to “sing it sweet and play it dirty.”"

      "description": "**Sagittaire & Ascetic Faces, Hirons, Cole Berliner**\n\nThe term “collision music” is typically associated with bassist/producer Bill Laswell, known for uniting artists from divergent sound worlds to create something unexpected. Coventry Suite Pt. 1, the experimental hip-hop and R&B project from Sagitairre’s Ivan Mairesse, is directly influenced by Laswell’s concept — “colliding” musicians from various communities in his hometown of LA to form the genre-agnostic group, Ascetic Faces. The album’s title is an additional nod to Coventry, the British town that spawned ska group The Specials and the multiracial 2-Tone movement.\n\n“I was interested early on in the recontextualization aspect of sampling, whether that came from Christian Marclay or Prince Paul,” explains Mairesse. “Marrying sounds or techniques from culturally distant spheres is a way of calling into question listeners' tendencies to keep these worlds separate. There is a certain political critique communicated in those juxtapositions. In a way, it’s an extension of pop-art.”"

      "description": "**The Macks, SLUTTONY**\n\nAll the identity and none of the crisis! The Macks are in their own pocket. Your fifth-favorite-band’s fifth-favorite-band are hardened road warriors and goblins of their basement studio.\n\nVirile and award-winning like a show horse, The Macks deliver a sonic-f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g-circus and they are turning heads around the country and internationally through the airwaves and their touring roadshow.\n\nWith their latest LP release, \"The Macks are a Knife,\" (via Devil Duck Records) The Macks have released their most poised and pungent LP as a result of their think-tank approach to producing records. Some legendary appearances at Pickathon, Treefort Fest, SXSW, Elsewhere Festival, and Lose Yr Mind have seen The Macks emerge from the PNW scene as a true 1 of 1 type band. With a lineup that has the group firing on all cylinders, both live and in the studio, The Macks have folks tuning in and spelling it right.\n\n**Sluttony** is a four-piece all femme rock band from Santa Cruz, CA. Formed in 2021, Sluttony quickly gained local following and re-ignited the college music scene in Santa Cruz. Their on-stage chemistry and charisma combined with the femme-rock energy of their performances quickly made Sluttony a cornerstone of the Santa Cruz house show scene, and they went on to sell out venues in town including Urbani's Cellar and The Catalyst Atrium. In March 2022, the band released their long awaited debut single \"Everybody's Business\", followed by their debut EP \"Another Something Nice\", through which they continued to explore their sound.\n\nBeyond Santa Cruz, the band has played numerous shows in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, playing a sold out show at The Smell - one of LA's notable DIY venues. In May 2023, Sluttony made their debut festival appearance at Shabang Music Festival.\n\nIn September 2023, the band relocated to Los Angeles. Their debut LP, produced by Jim Wirt, is set to be released in Winter 2025.\n\nThe band consists of Hannah Goodwin (lead vocals/guitar), Nina Maravic (guitar/vocals), Sabine Hovnanian (drums/vocals), and Caroline Margolis (bass)."
