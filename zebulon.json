      "description": "**Sagittaire & Ascetic Faces, Hirons, Delanova**\n\nThe term “collision music” is typically associated with bassist/producer Bill Laswell, known for uniting artists from divergent sound worlds to create something unexpected. Coventry Suite Pt. 1, the experimental hip-hop and R&B project from Sagitairre’s Ivan Mairesse, is directly influenced by Laswell’s concept — “colliding” musicians from various communities in his hometown of LA to form the genre-agnostic group, Ascetic Faces. The album’s title is an additional nod to Coventry, the British town that spawned ska group The Specials and the multiracial 2-Tone movement.\n\n“I was interested early on in the recontextualization aspect of sampling, whether that came from Christian Marclay or Prince Paul,” explains Mairesse. “Marrying sounds or techniques from culturally distant spheres is a way of calling into question listeners' tendencies to keep these worlds separate. There is a certain political critique communicated in those juxtapositions. In a way, it’s an extension of pop-art.”"

Some legendary appearances at Pickathon, Treefort Fest, SXSW, Elsewhere Festival, and Lose Yr Mind have seen The Macks emerge from the PNW scene as a true 1 of 1 type band. With a lineup that has the group firing on all cylinders, both live and in the studio, The Macks have folks tuning in and spelling it right.\n\n**Sluttony** is a four-piece all femme rock band from Santa Cruz, CA. Formed in 2021, Sluttony quickly gained local following and re-ignited the college music scene in Santa Cruz. Their on-stage chemistry and charisma combined with the femme-rock energy of their performances quickly made Sluttony a cornerstone of the Santa Cruz house show scene, and they went on to sell out venues in town including Urbani's Cellar and The Catalyst Atrium. In March 2022, the band released their long awaited debut single \"Everybody's Business\", followed by their debut EP \"Another Something Nice\", through which they continued to explore their sound.\n\nBeyond Santa Cruz, the band has played numerous shows in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, playing a sold out show at The Smell - one of LA's notable DIY venues. In May 2023, Sluttony made their debut festival appearance at Shabang Music Festival.\n\nIn September 2023, the band relocated to Los Angeles. Their debut LP, produced by Jim Wirt, is set to be released in Winter 2025.\n\nThe band consists of Hannah Goodwin (lead vocals/guitar), Nina Maravic (guitar/vocals), Sabine Hovnanian (drums/vocals), and Caroline Margolis (bass)."

      "description": "Iceage, Dutch Interior\n\n“Shake The Feeling” is open to interpretation. The phrase can refer to the Rock ‘n’ Roll clarion call of “shaking of some action.” Or it can be taken as a callback to the even more primal urge to “shake what your mama gave you.” Ultimately, the phrase can be seen as an expression of existentialism; an acknowledgement of our consigned inability to be free of the human condition. It’s the latter interpretation, the usage that–while ostensibly romantic–implies something inescapable, that Iceage are using for the title of their new record. As with everything Iceage does, it’s a come-on delivered as a threat, a sexy invitation to get irretrievably lost.\n\nWhile not as anachronistic as a B-sides album, an outtakes compilation is something older, classic rock bands, like Deep Purple or Pavement, have. Nobody saw this for Iceage. Hell, nobody saw Iceage surviving their first US tour, let alone living long enough as a band to have songs they actually left off of records. But Iceage haven’t just survived - they managed to get better, so much so that even their wretched castoffs shine in god’s light like golden teeth from a pirate’s sun bleached skull. Even as teens, the spirit was indeed in them, and it was a spirit of both epistemological violence and euphoric grace. When lead singer Elias Bender Rønnenfelt looked dead-eyed and stalwart out across those crowds and sang the chorus of “Total Drench,” he was speaking both truth and prophecy.\n\nAs with all of Iceage’s albums, whether it be the sensual daring-do of their dark-hardcore masterpiece debut, the Flying Nun-dappled “Oi!!!!” of You’re Nothing, the shift to cowpunk gothic romanticism on Plowing Into the Field of Love, or the space truckin’ gospel-rock of their most recent albums, Elias Bender Rønnenfelt, Johan Suurballe Wieth, Jakob Tvilling Pless and Dan Kjær Nielsen make the impossible seem effortless. Shake The Feeling: Outtakes & Rarities 2015-2021, the band’s second full length for Mexican Summer, is a collection of non-LP cuts (or “misfit children,” as Elias describes them) from the seven years during which Iceage made Plowing Into the Field of Love (2014), Beyondless (2018), and Seek Shelter (2021)."

      "description": "**re:VOLT, Skyler King**\n\n**re:VOLT is the ongoing collaboration of Jill Fraser, Peter Grenader and Thomas Klepper.**\n\n**Jill Fraser** is a composer and electronic music pioneer with a career spanning over 40 years, creating music for films, commercials, games, and, as she puts it, \"in the wild\" as entertainment. Her deep and ever-evolving curiosity about music as both a scientific and spiritual force comes to life in her forthcoming album, Earthly Pleasures. This project reimagines American revival hymns from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, using early Serge systems alongside modern tools like the Ableton Push 3. More than just creating expressive, personal music, Jill's work contemplates themes of death and the afterlife while considering how today's sources of meaning might be understood by future generations and technologies yet to come.\n\nJill Fraser set her sights on this creative path early in her career. Mentored by Morton Subotnick and studying with luminaries like Mel Powell and Earle Brown at CalArts, she also attended master classes with influential figures such as John Cage and Lou Harrison. These experiences, combined with her own artistic instincts, shaped her into an expansive and open-eared composer. Her work at Serge Modular in Hollywood further honed her visionary approach to music. In the 1980s, Jill brought modular synthesizers into Hollywood studios to score films, marking a new direction in film composition. Her credits include Personal Best and Cruising (both in collaboration with Jack Nitzsche), as well as \\*Hardcore\\* (directed by Paul Schrader). During this time, she was also active in the vibrant Los Angeles punk and spoken word scene, touring with singer Buffy Sainte-Marie and performance artist Ivan E. Roth. She performed modular synth sets opening for acts like The Minutemen and Henry Rollins, and in 1988, released the CD \\*Alphabetical Disorders\\* with Ivan on the electronic label Periodic Music.\n\nThroughout her career, Jill Fraser has composed both electronic and acoustic music for hundreds of TV commercials, working with major brands like Lexus, BMW, Honda, Porsche, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Mattel, Carl’s Jr., NBC, Apple, Adidas, Estee Lauder, Baskin Robbins, Yamaha Motorcycles, and many others. She has won three Clio Awards for original music and is a voting member of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2018, she wrote and performed music with the Zzyzx Society. Currently, Jill performs live with re:VOLT and her new album Earthly Pleasures is available on Drag City Records.\n\n**Peter Grenader** has an enduring history in electronic music. Studying composition at CalArts under Morton Subotnick, his works have been performed across the United States and Europe. His discography includes Secret Life (2013) on Coda Recordings, zZyzx Society with Jill Fraser, featuring Danny Carey, Chas Smith, and Thighpaulsandra (2018) on ZSR Records, Patch CV Two (2018) on Organic Records, Tool’s Fear Inoculum (2019) on RCA Records, and two albums with POV featuring Steve Roach, Theo Travis, Thighpaulsandra, Martin Shellard (2019/2020) distributed by Roach’s Timeroom Records.\n\nHe was a featured composer at the 17th American Composer’s Forum Salon in Venice. His Electrolux earned recognition by winning the Periòdic Music Festival in Barcelona, Spain. His work has also been showcased at numerous other festivals, including the SEAMUS National Conference, the University of North Texas, CalArts, Stony Brook University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Texas at Austin, Georgia State University's Pulse Field, the Florida Electro-Acoustic Music Festival, the 2003 Electric Rainbow Coalition Festival at Dartmouth, the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht, Holland, two wins at the Virginia Commonwealth University Music Festival, and three performances at the Los Angeles Sonic Odyssey.\n\nCollaborations with fellow creatives include Analoglive! along with film composer Gary Chang, Nine Inch Nails keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, Richard Devine, composer and instrument designer Chas Smith, Thighpaulsandra (of Coil and Spiritualized) and video artist Paul Tzanetopoulos at the Redcat Theater in Los Angeles. Other notable collaborations include zZyzx Society, The Third Ear, POV featuring Steve Roach, and several performances with re:VOLT at The Lab in San Fransisco, The Philosophical Research Society and 2220 Arts + Archives in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was featured on David Elliot’s 2018 synthesis documentary series Patch CV: Controlling Voltage. For the past 13 years he has served as the instrument and sound designer for the progressive metal band Tool and earned an RIAA gold record for his work on their album Fear Inoculum. A past member of the SEAMUS board of directors, he is the founder and primary designer for Electro-Acoustic Research (EAR) and Plan B Synthesizers.\n\n**Thomas Klepper** is a Los Angeles based sitarist and student of Etawah Gharana with renoun sitar master Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan, DJ, soundbath artist, producer and electronic musician who has released records under the aliases Romeo, LoTom, Rinpoche and Thomas K for the Association of Masks label. He has performed at Burning Man, the Disclosure Festival, Music For Dancers and The Higley Center for the Performing Arts among others.\n\nHe is the host of the Library of Sounds show for Dublab Radio and aims to create thought-provoking music that is rooted in tradition while at the same time paving the way into the future.\n\nhttp://www.re-volt.world"

The band’s early run of EPs established the Connecticut four-piece as a modern update on a certain strain of northeastern indie-rock. By the time the band’s debut album Am was released in 2013, Ovlov was getting comparisons to Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh tossed in their direction, and while those elements were certainly present in their sound, Ovlov always let catchy pop hooks slip into the mix too. On their third album, Buds, those pop elements are more pronounced than they’ve ever been before.\n\n“I would like to think that the songs on this album are all pop songs at the core,” says Steve Hartlett, the band’s songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist. On first blush, Buds won’t shock longtime Ovlov fans, but on repeat listens, those fuzzy, crushing guitars start to feel less like the central focus and more of a delivery system for Hartlett’s grander ambitions. “For the past few years, the number of rock bands I’ve been listening to has grown smaller and smaller,” says Hartlett. “Unfortunately, it’s the only genre and style I’ve ever really felt comfortable writing. That’s probably mostly because I write everything on a guitar. Don’t get me wrong, I love rock music—there’s nothing more satisfying than playing an E chord through a Big muff as loud as the amp will go—I just want to slowly progress into writing the most perfectly poppy of pop songs.”\n\nRecorded with the same producer and engineer who has handled every Ovlov album, Michael John Thomas III at his Black Lodge Studio in Brooklyn, Buds is the latest document of Ovlov’s slow and sturdy evolution. But this time, the band’s become even more of a family affair. Though Steve’s long been riffing alongside guitarist Morgan Luzzi, the band was started with Steve’s younger brother Theo on drums. This time around, their older brother Jon joined them on bass—and their dad, Ted, even stops in to rip a sax solo on “Cheer Up, Chihiro!” Considering the Hartlett brothers learned how to play music together, it’s a full circle moment as they all come together in service of making Ovlov’s most fully realized statement yet."

      "description": "**Rickshaw Billie's Burger Patrol, Here Lies Man**\n\n“Our catalog has never been short on big dumb riffs, but the idea on this record was to really turn the screw,” says RBBP bassist Aaron Metzdorf. On Big Dumb Riffs, that screw is cranked incredibly tight.\n\n“We just wanted ‘the part’: The opening of Pantera’s ‘Primal Concrete Sledge’, the breakdown in Primus’ ‘Pudding Time’ — the shit that makes you move and lose your mind. Just that part the whole time.”\n\nAcross 11 concise, taut songs — most clocking in around 2 minutes or less — Rickshaw Billie’s Burger Patrol demonstrates their skillful ability to blend the merciless low end of Leo Lydon’s 8-string guitar, Aaron Metzdorf’s masterful chordwork on the bass, and Sean St.Germain’s driving drumming.\n\nHot on the heels of their breakout 5th studio release Doom Wop (2023), Rickshaw Billie’s Burger Patrol returns with Big Dumb Riffs: A whole new variant of the fuzzed out, overdriven, melodic, groovy music they have been making since 2016. While Big Dumb Riffs is decidedly more aggressive and rhythmic, it still retains the overtly melodic feel of Doom Wop. But Leo Lydon’s vocals are considerably more angry and negative (song titles like “1-800-EAT-SHIT” and “Body Bag” should be a clue.)\n\n“The whole writing process was, ‘what if we just played two notes the whole song’,” Metzdorf says. “‘What if we tuned down to almost unusable string tension?’, ‘what if we write a record that will make everyone say ‘wow that is dumb’? Leo and I really move around on stage a lot. Being a dingus is crucial to the groove. All these riffs were designed to allow us to act bigger and dumber on stage.”\n\nBig Dumb Riffs will be available for streaming and download on March 22, 2024. LP to follow in late Spring."

      "description": "**Astrid Sonne**\n\nAstrid Sonne is a Danish, London-based composer and viola player. Throughout her acclaimed discography, Astrid Sonne has been carefully crafting different moods through electronic and acoustic instrumental endeavours. On her most recent album “Great Doubt” (January 2024) this skill is refined, now with the distinct addition of the composer's own vocal in the fore. The tone of each track is unmistakably Sonne’s, structured around contrasts through an impeccable sense of timing. Lyrics on the album are sparse, merely highlighting different scenes or emotional states of being, leaving the music to fill in the blanks. Yet they also form a pattern of ambiguity, consolidated through the album title, searching for answers through looking at how and what you are asking, questions for the world, questions of love. The viola, a trusted companion since Astrid Sonne’s youth, appears effortlessly throughout the album, fully integrated into the sonic universe; through a pizzicato driven arrangement in the poignant track “Almost” or along with booms and claps in mutated cinematic stabs during “Give my all”, paraphrasing Mariah Carey's 1997 ballad. Yet the string section also gives way to explorations of woodwinds, counterbalancing the bowed movements with digital brass and airy flutes. Finally, beats and detuned piano are fresh additions to the soundscape, cementing how Sonne’s practice is always evolving into new territories."

      "description": "**Crack Cloud, Self Improvement**\n\nThe first iteration of Crack Cloud was formed nearly a decade ago as a proxy-rehab outlet on the fringes of Calgary, where two EPs and their accompanying visual pieces were created during this time. By 2017, several members had relocated to Vancouver. It was after the move that the band produced their astounding 2020 album Pain Olympics, and their 2022 follow up, Tough Baby. All at once, their vision became expansive, cinematic, and precarious.\n\nNow, their third full-length studio album, Red Mile, acts as both a tribute and a homecoming. Members have since left Vancouver and returned to Calgary; returned to the long stretch of land colloquially referred to as the red mile. But what of the time away from home? After a decade of personal and collective growth, what does home even mean? To Crack Cloud, this is the liminal message demanding to be explored throughout Red Mile. The throughline thread of samsara – rebirth and life’s cyclical pattern weaving together the eight tracks.\n\nA departure from the hermetic, multi-year gestation of Pain Olympics and Tough Baby, Red Mile is the product of swift, group collaboration. Recorded predominantly between the outskirts of Joshua Tree, California, and Calgary, Alberta, the resulting album is informed by a bittersweet melange of new beginnings and familiar places.Crack Cloud have learned to concentrate their multi-hyphenate energy, re-emerging as a lean, focused rock outfit producing their most mature and vital work yet. The sprawling, novelistic structures of their previous records have been harnessed and condensed, but never boiled down. The band is derisive as ever to deal in superficiality. Through playful melodies and elliptical guitar soliloquy they deliver a record of exceptional depth and unprecious warmth; creating a lived-in feel not dissimilar to a loved picture frame: a captured still, carefully mended with electrical tape."

Their third album Berserk is out March 7th.\n\nBerserk embodies the chaos of an era where nothing feels stable, where the self is both the center of its own universe and being sucked into the disorienting orbit of a hyper-connected, hyper-consumptive culture. Berserk delivers the kind of eclectic, electric energy that traverses through the plains of pop-punk, post-punk, disco-punk, and schizo-synth-punk, and bites hard and fast, all while pushing the listener to confront the gnawing absurdity of living in the world today.\n\n**MUSCLE BEACH**\n\nPlay loud fast jams. The band is an impact. An immediacy, a sting. A blunt concision, a contortion into the shape of a room. It’s quivering limbs spent to shreds at the end of a show when we check back into our bodies and recount what we made them do. It’s an intervention into a moment— the moment of a given night and the moment of today’s Los Angeles in all its ills and glory"

Now, she prepares to release a collection of demos written while watching late fall turn to winter in Upstate New York. These self-recorded sketches became a focus point during a solitary and contemplative season in her life. The EP is fittingly titled “Home Recordings” to capture the relaxed and raw nature of their creation. Anna writes of these songs: “The ‘Home Recordings EP’ is a work-in-progress collection of home-recorded winter songs. A study in simplicity, leaning into a minimal approach while embracing the quietness of a season of grief. These songs are meant to be a little rough around the edges, honest and unrefined.” The “Home Recordings” EP releases in March of 2025 and marks both the end of a season and the beginning of something so much more."

The original group – Cory Hanson (guitar, vocals), Lee Landey (bass), Evan Burrows (drums) and Daniel Martens (guitar) - recorded Ganglion Reef before too long and attracted the attentions of GOD? Records, In the Red and Drag City all at once. A deal was dreamed up and hammered down: first album with GOD?, second with In the Red, and then Drag City. What would the result of THAT be?\n\nSo began the years of furious activity; near-constant days of touring and recording and releasing. Between August 2014 and September 2017, Wand released Ganglion Reef, Golem, 1000 Days and Plum, a period in which they also reduced from quartet to trio (less Daniel) and then expanded to quintet (with the addition of Robbie Cody (guitar) and Sofia Arreguin (keys, vocals, percussion)). All this action had launched them onto the world-wide stage, which suggested increasingly more to do all the time. No prob: everyone was playing in other bands, and Cory started a solo career too. No time like the present! A maxi-EP, “Perfume”, appeared in the Spring of 2018 and the double-album Laughing Matter dropped in April 2019. Touring continued apace; it was only the CoCo craze of the following year that that forced any downtime – and even that gap was filled with the mixing of an epic live document, the 2xLP Spiders In the Rain, dropped in the pan in 2022. All this while Evan focused on his long-time other band, Behavior, plus Pink Trash Can, and Robby joined in on both endeavors, while Sofia played with Shannon Lay and Kamikaze Palm Tree, and Cory wrote and recorded two more solo albums!"
