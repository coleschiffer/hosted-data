      "description": "In 2021, amid the Covid lockdowns, **Melinda Sullivan** and jazz pianist **Larry Goldings** formed a duet, initially posting an improvisational rendition of Somewhere for a virtual party honoring Sullivan’s father-in-law. Their collaboration quickly gained traction, sparking conversations among jazz musicians, tap dancers, and broader music fans, with figures like Sheila E., Robert Glasper, and Questlove joining the dialogue. As Covid restrictions lifted in 2022, they began performing live, blending jazz, funk, commercial dance, and underground tap. Their unique, eclectic sound attracted a dedicated following on Instagram and Patreon, with fans seeking their improvised performances in Southern California clubs.\n\nTheir work is part of a historical jazz-tap tradition dating back to the 1920s, when jazz music and tap dance developed in parallel. This tradition was cemented by the 1921 Broadway show Shuffle Along and further popularized by The Cotton Club in 1984. While this collaboration had gone underground since the early 2000s, Goldings and Sullivan’s platform has reignited public interest. Goldings praised Sullivan's talents, calling him a great jazz instrumentalist. Jazz journalist Allen Morrison noted that their sound forms a new kind of jazz piano trio, with Goldings playing piano and synth bass, and Sullivan providing percussion on a portable board. Their upcoming album *Big Foot* released in August 2024 on Colorfield Records.\n\nDoors at 8 PM.\n\n$30 adv/$35 at door"

Matthews possesses a warm and expressive tenor voice and a talent for songwriting. While he drew from British folk traditions in his work, his greatest inspiration came from American country, folk, and roots music, and he blended their timeless themes with a hippie-fied pastoral feel that was warm and sweet or sorrowful, depending on the song. Though he would dabble in soft rock, power pop, and synth pop in the late '70s and early '80s, he always returned to the sun-dappled sound of the country-folk hybrid that was his trademark.\n\n**Russ Tolman** is a singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his work in the 1980s Paisley Underground with True West, whose dark, hypnotic sound set them apart from their peers. After leaving the band, he launched a successful solo career with albums like *Totem Poles and Glory Holes* and *Down In Earthquake Town*, collaborating with artists like Johnette Napolitano and Howe Gelb. His music blends folk, rock, and experimental sounds, with his 2019 album *Goodbye El Dorado* paying tribute to the Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter era.\n\n$25 adv + DICE fees / $30 at the door\n\nDoors at 8 PM"
