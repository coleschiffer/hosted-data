      "description": "A vital figure in the history of British folk, **Ian Matthews** (also billed as **Iain Matthews**) was a founding member of the pioneering U.K. folk-rock band Fairport Convention before he went on to found his own group, Matthews' Southern Comfort, and later moved on to a solo career. Matthews possesses a warm and expressive tenor voice and a talent for songwriting. While he drew from British folk traditions in his work, his greatest inspiration came from American country, folk, and roots music, and he blended their timeless themes with a hippie-fied pastoral feel that was warm and sweet or sorrowful, depending on the song. Though he would dabble in soft rock, power pop, and synth pop in the late '70s and early '80s, he always returned to the sun-dappled sound of the country-folk hybrid that was his trademark.\n\n**Russ Tolman** is a singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his work in the 1980s Paisley Underground with True West, whose dark, hypnotic sound set them apart from their peers. After leaving the band, he launched a successful solo career with albums like *Totem Poles and Glory Holes* and *Down In Earthquake Town*, collaborating with artists like Johnette Napolitano and Howe Gelb. His music blends folk, rock, and experimental sounds, with his 2019 album *Goodbye El Dorado* paying tribute to the Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter era.\n\n$25 adv + DICE fees / $30 at the door\n\nDoors at 8 PM"

Taylor is a multi-instrumentalist who has collaborated with artists such as Bright Eyes, Phoebe Bridgers, Michael Stipe of REM, Daniel Johnston, and Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows.\n\nTaylor began her career in the band Little Red Rocket, signing to Geffen at just 16 years old, before forming the indie-dream pop dup Azure Ray in the early 2000s. Azure Ray gained recognition with their debut self-titled album, with songs featured in films and TV shows, most notably the song “Sleep,” a favorite of Taylor Swift. After meeting the band in Athens, Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst invited the band on tour and introduced them to Saddle Creek where Azure Ray ultimately released four albums and three EPs. During that time, Taylor also lent her voice, piano and drumming skills to numerous Bright Eyes records.\n\nMaria announced her solo career in 2005 – a change that would pave the way for five critically acclaimed albums and collaborations. Across 8 LPs, Taylor’s critically acclaimed solo work includiesher debut “11:11” which included “Song Beneath the Song” which has appeared multiple times on television including Grey’s Anatomy, through 2017’s “In the Next Life” which included the single “If Only” featuring long time collaborator Conor Oberst, appearing in NBC’s “This Is Us.”\n\nMost recently Taylor and Fink reconnected to release Azure Ray’s first full length record in 6 years, scored music for a Hallmark series, performed with Daniel Johnston during his final tour, appeared on several Phoebe Bridgers’ songs (covers of John Prine \"Summer's End” and \"Funny Feeling\" by Bo Burnham) and on multiple tracks from Bright Eyes' 2022 Companion reissue series. She joined the band as their drummer during Bright Eyes' 2023 world tour of the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2024, Taylor began recording her yet-to-be titled 9th solo album with producers Mike Mogis (Brights Eyes, BoyGenius) at ARC Studios in Omaha , Brad Armstrong, and Ben Brodin (First Aid Kit), with arrangements by Nate Walcott (Bright Eyes, Red Hot Chili Peppers). The album is currently in production, with plans for a 2025 release."

With the release of her latest EP *“Fumbling Towards Glory”* Pearlman explores themes of femininity, defiance, and intuition, set to a lush soundscape that mixes elements of 90’s, folk, and alternative.\n\nAn LA native who spent her formative years performing music and studying philosophy in New Orleans, it was New Orleans that awoke the performer in her soul; learning piano and guitar along the way and fronting a live band singing in clubs and at jazz festivals. After returning home from college, Pearlman found success as a songwriter penning Grammy-nominated songs for Kelly Clarkson, Grace Potter, and others. She has also lent her vocals to artists like Gryffin, Dijon, and Lukas Graham.\n\nPushing the boundaries with both her music and lifestyle, Katie found inspiration in the community she created after moving to Taos, New Mexico, and in the divine feminine energy from influences such as Patti Smith, Joni Mitchell, and Alanis Morissette. “I follow the cosmic feeling,” says Katie. “I’m designing my own life. I want to grow. And I want to make people feel less alone. A pioneer on the journey of coming home to yourself, Katie Pearlman is following her magic.\n\nKatie will be opening up for Lola Kirke on her Trailblazer tour after playing Healing Force of The Universe, where she is joined by **Susy Sun** and **Francesca Blanchard**.\n\n$15 adv + DICE fees / $18 at the door\n\nDoors at 8 PM"

      "description": "Sid The Cat Presents\n\nSean Hayes\n\n4/28/2025 at Healing Force Of The Universe\n\nSean Hayes is a Bay Area singer-songwriter who makes music to dance to or cry to, or maybe both at the same time. He was born in New York City, raised in North Carolina, and honed his earliest musical chops in a band playing Irish and old-time tunes — but his unique style of deeply felt, R&B-inflected folk really matured during his two decades singing and playing in cafes, bars, and night clubs of San Francisco.\n\nHis voice layers wonder and heartache upon grit and gravel, sex and soul. His lyrics carry an unpretentious wisdom. He’s dueted with Aimee Mann; been covered by the Be Good Tanyas; and toured with Anais Mitchell (performing songs from Hadestown, before it was an award-winning Broadway show). His songs have appeared on NPR, NBC and HBO."

      "description": "**Macie Stewar**t’s upcoming album *When the Distance is Blue* (International Anthem, 2024), out March 21, offers a cinematic and symphonic exploration of life's in-between moments. The album weaves together Stewart’s prepared piano improvisations, lush string arrangements, and field recordings captured during a year of touring, creating a sonic landscape that marks her most striking work yet. A Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist, composer, and improviser, Stewart is known for her deep listening and technical prowess, with Pitchfork calling her one of the standout collaborators of the past five years.\n\nIn 2014, Stewart co-founded the experimental duo Finom, which has released four records and garnered praise for its avant-pop, art-rock sound. Their latest album Not God (2024) showcases the duo’s signature harmonies, lyricism, and innovative sonic textures. Stewart’s composition work spans various disciplines, dissolving boundaries between genres. She composed for Hubbard Street Dance’s Half of Us in 2021, worked with Finom bandmate Sima Cunningham and Alex Grelle on a performance piece honoring Kate Bush, and scored a 50-piece orchestra for the Pacific Northwest Ballet’s Before I Was (2022). More recently, she created a sound installation for Robyn Mineko Williams’ Hisako House and contributed to the ESS Florisonic Installation at Lincoln Park Conservatory in 2024.\n\nDoors at 8 PM\n\n$15 ADV (+dice fees)/$18 DOOR"
