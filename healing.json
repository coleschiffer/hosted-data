      "description": "In 2021, amid the Covid lockdowns, **Melinda Sullivan** and jazz pianist **Larry Goldings** formed a duet, initially posting an improvisational rendition of Somewhere for a virtual party honoring Sullivan’s father-in-law. Their collaboration quickly gained traction, sparking conversations among jazz musicians, tap dancers, and broader music fans, with figures like Sheila E., Robert Glasper, and Questlove joining the dialogue. As Covid restrictions lifted in 2022, they began performing live, blending jazz, funk, commercial dance, and underground tap. Their unique, eclectic sound attracted a dedicated following on Instagram and Patreon, with fans seeking their improvised performances in Southern California clubs.\n\nTheir work is part of a historical jazz-tap tradition dating back to the 1920s, when jazz music and tap dance developed in parallel. This tradition was cemented by the 1921 Broadway show Shuffle Along and further popularized by The Cotton Club in 1984. While this collaboration had gone underground since the early 2000s, Goldings and Sullivan’s platform has reignited public interest. Goldings praised Sullivan's talents, calling him a great jazz instrumentalist. Jazz journalist Allen Morrison noted that their sound forms a new kind of jazz piano trio, with Goldings playing piano and synth bass, and Sullivan providing percussion on a portable board. Their upcoming album Big Foot released in August 2024 on Colorfield Records.\n\nDoors at 8 PM.\n\n$30 adv/$35 at door"

He was born in New York City, raised in North Carolina, and honed his earliest musical chops in a band playing Irish and old-time tunes — but his unique style of deeply felt, R&B-inflected folk really matured during his two decades singing and playing in cafes, bars, and night clubs of San Francisco.\n\nHis voice layers wonder and heartache upon grit and gravel, sex and soul. His lyrics carry an unpretentious wisdom. He’s dueted with Aimee Mann; been covered by the Be Good Tanyas; and toured with Anais Mitchell (performing songs from Hadestown, before it was an award-winning Broadway show). His songs have appeared on NPR, NBC and HBO."

The album weaves together Stewart’s prepared piano improvisations, lush string arrangements, and field recordings captured during a year of touring, creating a sonic landscape that marks her most striking work yet. A Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist, composer, and improviser, Stewart is known for her deep listening and technical prowess, with Pitchfork calling her one of the standout collaborators of the past five years.\n\nIn 2014, Stewart co-founded the experimental duo Finom, which has released four records and garnered praise for its avant-pop, art-rock sound. Their latest album Not God (2024) showcases the duo’s signature harmonies, lyricism, and innovative sonic textures. Stewart’s composition work spans various disciplines, dissolving boundaries between genres. She composed for Hubbard Street Dance’s Half of Us in 2021, worked with Finom bandmate Sima Cunningham and Alex Grelle on a performance piece honoring Kate Bush, and scored a 50-piece orchestra for the Pacific Northwest Ballet’s Before I Was (2022). More recently, she created a sound installation for Robyn Mineko Williams’ Hisako House and contributed to the ESS Florisonic Installation at Lincoln Park Conservatory in 2024.\n\nDoors at 8 PM\n\n$15 ADV (+dice fees)/$18 DOOR"
