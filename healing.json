      "description": "In 2021, amid the Covid lockdowns, **Melinda Sullivan** and jazz pianist **Larry Goldings** formed a duet, initially posting an improvisational rendition of Somewhere for a virtual party honoring Sullivan’s father-in-law. Their collaboration quickly gained traction, sparking conversations among jazz musicians, tap dancers, and broader music fans, with figures like Sheila E., Robert Glasper, and Questlove joining the dialogue. As Covid restrictions lifted in 2022, they began performing live, blending jazz, funk, commercial dance, and underground tap. Their unique, eclectic sound attracted a dedicated following on Instagram and Patreon, with fans seeking their improvised performances in Southern California clubs.\n\nTheir work is part of a historical jazz-tap tradition dating back to the 1920s, when jazz music and tap dance developed in parallel. This tradition was cemented by the 1921 Broadway show Shuffle Along and further popularized by The Cotton Club in 1984. While this collaboration had gone underground since the early 2000s, Goldings and Sullivan’s platform has reignited public interest. Goldings praised Sullivan's talents, calling him a great jazz instrumentalist. Jazz journalist Allen Morrison noted that their sound forms a new kind of jazz piano trio, with Goldings playing piano and synth bass, and Sullivan providing percussion on a portable board. Their upcoming album *Big Foot* released in August 2024 on Colorfield Records.\n\nDoors at 8 PM.\n\n$30 adv/$35 at door"

Matthews possesses a warm and expressive tenor voice and a talent for songwriting. While he drew from British folk traditions in his work, his greatest inspiration came from American country, folk, and roots music, and he blended their timeless themes with a hippie-fied pastoral feel that was warm and sweet or sorrowful, depending on the song. Though he would dabble in soft rock, power pop, and synth pop in the late '70s and early '80s, he always returned to the sun-dappled sound of the country-folk hybrid that was his trademark.\n\n**Russ Tolman** is a singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his work in the 1980s Paisley Underground with True West, whose dark, hypnotic sound set them apart from their peers. After leaving the band, he launched a successful solo career with albums like *Totem Poles and Glory Holes* and *Down In Earthquake Town*, collaborating with artists like Johnette Napolitano and Howe Gelb.

      "description": "**Elf Freedom** is the musical and artistic collaboration between Nora Keyes and Bee Appleseed. Using elves as an archetype for the human nature spirit that exists across cultures around the world, the intention of the project is to help people feel more connected to nature through music and create sonic experiences which transcend the stresses of everyday life. Concerts range between more delicate soundbath performances where audiences lie down on the floor to louder rock performances, occasionally featuring multiple guests. Given the improvised nature of the concerts, that no songs are written beforehand nor repeated afterward, the audio from every show is always recorded and archived for later release. Audiences are likely to feel elevated, connected, and transformed during this unique listening experience as the group takes listeners on a musical journey like no other. Elf Freedom is a phenomenon that must be experienced to be believed. It is a band, it is a political movement, and it is certainly a force of nature.\n\nConjuring a mysterious brew of folk, psychedelia, world music, and progressive rock, **Immaterial Possession** are a group from Athens, Georgia whose music takes listeners into a world all their own.\n\n$10 adv + DICE fees / $13 at the door\n\nDoors at 8 PM"

He was born in New York City, raised in North Carolina, and honed his earliest musical chops in a band playing Irish and old-time tunes — but his unique style of deeply felt, R&B-inflected folk really matured during his two decades singing and playing in cafes, bars, and night clubs of San Francisco.\n\nHis voice layers wonder and heartache upon grit and gravel, sex and soul. His lyrics carry an unpretentious wisdom. He’s dueted with Aimee Mann; been covered by the Be Good Tanyas; and toured with Anais Mitchell (performing songs from Hadestown, before it was an award-winning Broadway show). His songs have appeared on NPR, NBC and HBO."

      "description": "**Macie Stewar**t’s upcoming album *When the Distance is Blue* (International Anthem, 2024), out March 21, offers a cinematic and symphonic exploration of life's in-between moments. The album weaves together Stewart’s prepared piano improvisations, lush string arrangements, and field recordings captured during a year of touring, creating a sonic landscape that marks her most striking work yet. A Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist, composer, and improviser, Stewart is known for her deep listening and technical prowess, with Pitchfork calling her one of the standout collaborators of the past five years.\n\nIn 2014, Stewart co-founded the experimental duo Finom, which has released four records and garnered praise for its avant-pop, art-rock sound. Their latest album Not God (2024) showcases the duo’s signature harmonies, lyricism, and innovative sonic textures. Stewart’s composition work spans various disciplines, dissolving boundaries between genres. She composed for Hubbard Street Dance’s Half of Us in 2021, worked with Finom bandmate Sima Cunningham and Alex Grelle on a performance piece honoring Kate Bush, and scored a 50-piece orchestra for the Pacific Northwest Ballet’s Before I Was (2022). More recently, she created a sound installation for Robyn Mineko Williams’ Hisako House and contributed to the ESS Florisonic Installation at Lincoln Park Conservatory in 2024.\n\nDoors at 8 PM\n\n$15 ADV (+dice fees)/$18 DOOR"
