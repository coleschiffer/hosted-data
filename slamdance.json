          "description": "<p>A look at the intimate world of young non-binary trans photographer Laurence Philomène as they put together their first book, Puberty, a series of self-portraits documenting their transition during hormone therapy. Mirroring Philomène’s autobiographical approach, LARRY (they/them) highlights the cinematic power of the artist’s vibrant, colour-saturated images and above all, their willingness to share their story with authenticity and vulnerability. Gender non-conforming identities, body diversity and the challenges of self-affirmation are also explored through an exclusive foray into Philomène’s family and community. Beyond the story of individual transformation, the film chronicles a society that is likewise transitioning, evolving as it grows. A celebration of those who refuse to conform, LARRY (they/them) is a luminous and engaging portrait of the complex, often misunderstood multiplicity of trans and non-binary identities and experiences, bringing to the screen one of the most inspiring and original voices of their generation and an LGBTQ+ community icon.</p>",

Dhadkai stands as the world's only village predominantly afflicted by deaf-mutism, a mysterious phenomenon that continues to baffle experts.</p>\n<p>‘Only if the Baby Cries’ films Misra Khatoon and Mohammad Iqbal, a young couple in their 20’s, brace themselves with fear, anxiety and hope as they approach childbirth. As the time for the birth approaches, the villagers and relatives gather around their home, creating noise with banging drums, clanging utensils, and whistling—the village’s tradition to test the newborn's response.</p>\n<p>According to the village's  beliefs and experiences, if the newborn cries loudly but keeps the eyes closed for the first two days, they might be deaf. However, confirming if the newborn can't talk usually takes around six months of careful observation and patience.</p>",

From birth, doctors warn that his life will be overshadowed by limitations. Ben yearns for an ordinary life free from the harsh scrutiny he faces daily. However, each experience of adversity, including relentless bullying and a series of painful surgeries, ignites a fire within him. Wrestling becomes his proving ground, a place where he learns to transform his facial difference into a source of power. Determined to succeed, he pushes himself relentlessly, breaking through physical, social, and even romantic barriers that once seemed insurmountable. But as unexpected challenges arise and ridicule resurfaces, Ben finds himself at a defining crossroads: fade into the background of a “normal” life, or fully embrace his unique path and boldly stand out.</p>",

Camilla is an artist and a feminist, and there isn't much she and her dad agree on, but despite that, they share a strong bond. It is in the intersection of love, humor and frustration that the film unfolds. Camilla tries to understand how she and her dad could become each other's opposites and what it takes for a relationship to continue to exist in today's cancel culture.</p>",

In the film we learn that Elvis had it, which explains his wild dance moves and pain pill addiction. A Miss America had it, but you’d never know. What differentiates EDS and other complicated illnesses is their invisibility—a lack of awareness and accurate diagnostics—which too often leads to stigmatizing, medical gaslighting, and denial of treatment or insurance coverage.</p>\n<p>COMPLICATED takes the viewer into a hidden world of brave young people trying to thrive with a complex illness, mothers risking loss of custody to help them, and medical and child protective systems failing them at every turn.

In the film we learn that Elvis had it, which explains his wild dance moves and pain pill addiction. A Miss America had it, but you’d never know. What differentiates EDS and other complicated illnesses is their invisibility—a lack of awareness and accurate diagnostics—which too often leads to stigmatizing, medical gaslighting, and denial of treatment or insurance coverage.</p>\n<p>COMPLICATED takes the viewer into a hidden world of brave young people trying to thrive with a complex illness, mothers risking loss of custody to help them, and medical and child protective systems failing them at every turn. But through their advocating for themselves and researching their own disease genetics, a glimmer of hope appears on the horizon.</p>",

She believes they are silver but, when she dips the first spoon into a can of silver polish, it vanishes. The woman is Hanne Ioannou, the grandmother of the film director, Sophia Ioannou Gjerding. </p>\n<p>From this vantage point, the film considers different things that we consider to be heritage: from the silver spoon that disappeared to the inherited knowledge about insects from an entomological collection. It then explores how our relationship to objects and other beings are influenced by video games, and in particular how certain video games mirror the act of gathering or foraging, but to the extent to which it becomes hoarding.</p>",
