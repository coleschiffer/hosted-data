But for James’ third release, Medium Raw, producer and Easy Eye Sound label head Dan Auerbach envisioned something quite different for the Alabama-bred singer-songwriter- guitarist’s rawboned, sometimes scarifying music.\n\n“Day of the first session, I had my GPS routed to Easy Eye,” James recalls. “We ran into some traffic, and I texted \\[engineer M.\\] Allen \\[Parker\\] — ‘Hey man, sorry, we’re gonna be about 15 minutes late.’ And he said, ‘It’s OK, we’re still getting set up at the house.’ And I was like, ‘What house?’ ‘We’re recording at this house, it’s really cool.’ It was news to me! It felt unusual in the moment, which I think makes you play the songs differently. But I’m really happy with and proud of the results.”\n\n“I wanted to try to find that power of when I first saw him, when it was just him and his guitar,” Auerbach explains. “After working with him a couple of times in the studio, I felt like I wasn’t going to be able to do it in the same kind of way. The comforts and luxuries of the studio, where you’re able to hear everything and make adjustments and changes, wasn’t right for this project.”\n\n“Some of my favorite albums are those Arhoolie records produced by Chris Strachwitz that were recorded in houses, by Fred McDowell, Lightnin’ Hopkins. I felt like we might get better results if we did it in a house.”"

But if I can make something that someone can tap into emotionally while also making it enjoyable to listen to, then I’ve done my job.”\n\n“ There’s something truly special about discovering and sharing debut singles from emerging artists. The excitement of experiencing something new and fresh is simply unparalleled. Recently, I stumbled upon an amazing indie track that left me in awe. With its dreamy instrumentals and mesmerizing synths, this song is an absolute treat for the ears. ” - Filip Zemčík via Start Track"

In a departure from the self-produced approach of her 2019 debut Refuge Cove and its 2022 follow-up Storm Queen—the Melbourne-based artist worked with producer Jonathan Wilson (Angel Olsen, Father John Misty, Margo Price) at his Topanga Canyon studio to dream up a lavishly orchestrated sound that fully accommodates the depth and scope of her vocal prowess.\n\nWith its visceral reflection on grief and self-destruction and emotional violence, Ramona brings a stunning new grandeur to Cummings’ music while refusing to soften or temper its humanity. “It’s emotional and grand, like a metamorphosis in real time,” Rolling Stone."

His intuitive creative process often draws from traditional music and archival field recordings - incorporating elements of songs from the past into new work. He is, according to Ann Powers of NPR, \"maybe the leading interpreter of American folk music right now...\"\n\nFussell’s most recent album When I’m Called was released to critical acclaim by Fat Possum Records in the summer of 2024. The album was produced by James Elkington and features Blake Mills (guitars), Ben Whiteley (bass), and Joe Westerlund (drums), along with additional vocals from Joan Shelley and Robin Holcomb.\n\nFussell and Elkington also wrote and recorded the music for Rebuilding, a new feature film directed by Max Walker-Silverman that is set to premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n“Fussell’s music often comes with complex citations; he is a folksinger in the truest sense, collecting ideas and melodies and lyrics from distant and disparate traditions, looking for the things that unite us in our humanity.” - The New Yorker\n\n“(Fussell) is one of the great magpies of American song, collecting forgotten, tarnished gems with a folklorist’s zeal… his renditions aren’t so much cover versions as composites…” – The Guardian"

India’s musical journey was not typical. “Having grown up poor, there was a lot of pressure for me to ‘go to college and make money’ so I convinced myself that music was a hobby”. Ramey, a domestic violence survivor got a law degree and became a domestic violence prosecutor. “I thought if I was helping people like my Mom, I would like being a lawyer more”. Despite her love of helping people, Ramey’s love for music won in the end. She gave up her law career to become a full time musician and songwriter and has never looked back.\n\nSince then Ramey has put out five studio albums. Her 2017 album, and first national release, Snake Handler landed her on Rolling Stone's 10 New Country Artists You Need To Know list and earned her praise and attentions from American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation among others . Her 2020 album Shallow Graves earned her even more recognition from the likes of Ralph McClean of the BBC who said \"Ramey is a singer of the truth. Long may she shine\" and Rolling Stone who named her a pick of the week and featured a full interview and review calling her \"Part honky-tonk, part Black Sabbath\". She has been a two time SXSW and a three time Americanafest showcasing artist and recently released her fifth studio album, Baptized By The Blaze produced by Luke Wooten (The SteelDrivers, Sunny Sweeney, Deirks Bentley, Brad Paisley).\n\nReleased in August 2024, Baptized By The Blaze has taken off and is proving to be India's most successful album yet receiving high praise from Saving Country Music, No Depression, American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation and many more. She is touring extensively and has had the pleasure of opening for rising Outlaw Country and Americana star, Corb Lund and Grammy-nominated Maggie Rose. Ramey will start off her 2025 in the line-up of the Sirius XM Outlaw Country Cruise and has spring tour dates filling up her calendar."

The two bonded over their shared love of 90s hip hop and indie rock and quickly found a formula that combined these influences. \"With Stephen’s ear for hooks it came together effortlessly” McCammon said of the band's conception.\n\nAfter a stretch of singles, they made their debut with Years in the spring of 2018. In its first year as a band, Lean garnered the praise of NYLON, Indie Shuffle, IMPOSE, Buzz Bands LA: putting them on the radar of Kitsuné, and high-profile Spotify and Apple Music playlists.\n\nWhat the press has been saying about Lean:\n\n\"The perfect make-out song\" - NYLON\n\n\"Just good ol' fashioned, high quality indie pop.\" - Indie Shuffle\n\n\"Their single “Come Back” belies its facade of indie-pop insouciance; it’s a dart aimed at a poison person.\" -Buzz Bands LA"

Succinct pauses, surreal frequencies and effects, breakneck pace and sharply hurled vocals characterize the band’s aesthetic, which seems as though it is rooted in a sort of nasty-sound-meets-highbrow-message ethos. Fueled by the onslaught of society’s insanity and driven mad by tinnitus, Justin Pearson (The Locust, Dead Cross, Planet B), Brian Amalfitano (ACxDC), Scott Osment (Weak Flesh), and Jason Klein (Run With The Hunted), approach music as an opportunity to confront our collective sicknesses. We’ve got to try to listen, lest we all frolic headfirst towards the bright side of death, dragging this pillaged planet down with us. So whether you think the music is a radical disruption to the airwaves or just headache-inducing noise, you can feel free to tell them the brutal truth– they can’t hear you anyway."

      "description": "Sid The Cat Presents\n\nMatthew Logan Vasquez\n\nwith Softjaw\n\n4/13/2025 at Gold-Diggers\n\n21+\n\nBest-known as the co-founder and frontman for shapeshifting heartland indie rockers Delta Spirit, Matthew Logan Vasquez's fiery delivery and thought-provoking lyrics draw from a huge and versatile well of influences, including Gordon Gano, Kurt Cobain, Neil Young, and Thom Yorke. As a solo artist, he juggles elements of indie rock, electronic pop, R&B, and soulful Americana, flirting with despondency, but ultimately succumbing to beatitude. Vasquez’s latest release Frank’s Full Moon Saloon - an album that delivers more raw versions of songs that span the band’s 20 year career, was released in February this year. Part 2 & 3 of the Franks series will be rolling out through 2025."

      "description": "Founded in 2015, The Sextones built a devoted following across the West Coast before\n\nbreaking out internationally with their self-released 2017 debut album Moonlight Vision, quickly\n\nfinding success in Japan via P-Vine Records. Soon after, the band began touring extensively\n\nacross the U.S. and Europe, quickly garnering international attention from soul music fans,\n\nrecord collectors, and critics alike. A steady roster of national performances cemented their\n\nreputation as critical and festival favorites, with Okayplayer describing Moonlight Vision as “The\n\nresult of a Herculean work ethic, mixed with a Sherlock Holmes-esque attention to detail and a\n\nnuance that can be appreciated by true music lovers.” Live For Live Music detailed their musical\n\napproach, writing: “By taking classic sounds, modernizing them, and making them their own, the\n\nSextones have carved out a niche for themselves within the modern funk and soul movement,\n\nand we are digging every second of it.\" And PopDust praised the group as “A glowing reminder\n\nof where music came from, and serves as a vehicle to light a fire under a new generation.”\n\nFriends since childhood, The Sextones are Mark Sexton (guitar, vocals), Alexander Korostinsky\n\n(bass), Daniel Weiss (drums), and Christopher Sexton (piano). Having known each other for so\n\nlong, their musical chemistry is effortless and forms the foundation of the band’s longevity and\n\ncreative workflow. Despite their bond, each member has been able to channel their creativity\n\ninto other acclaimed groups—Alexander and Mark with their cinematic-soul project Whatitdo\n\nArchive Group and Daniel's recent engagement in the soul/jazz group Delvon Lamarr Organ\n\nTrio. Flexing their creative muscle individually has only strengthened The Sextones’ collective\n\nsongwriting ability and heralds their formidable return to the spotlight with their upcoming record\n\nthis fall. With their recent signing to heavy-weight soul label, Record Kicks, the self-made heroes\n\nof soul begin a new chapter in their sonic journey, ready to scale new heights and plumb deep\n\nemotional depths in service of the genre they love."

      "description": "Damaged Disco Presents the record release show for Science in Nature (ex-Members of The Faint, Soft Kill, Moving Units) with Warsaw Pact and Bite Marx on Friday April 18 at Gold-Diggers!\n\nScience in Nature is the practice of aligning patterns with naturally occurring phenomena. Working largely without sonic or lyrical distortion and within the deliberate borders of a traditional 3-piece rock band, we exist somewhere inside the awkwardness of a new dance and the routine of strained muscle memory. Los Angeles’ Joel Petersen (ex-The Faint, Broken Spindles) is on guitar and vocals, Han-Su Kim is on bass and harmony vocals, and Danny Deleon (Soft Kill, Moving Units) is on drums. Our sum is greater than our parts. We feel tension in the spaces—and beauty in the clarity. Please enjoy with us.\n\nBringing punk back into post-punk, Warsaw Pact sits anxiously on the edge of the LA Goth scene, trading angular guitar riffs with up tempo dance-punk beats backed by a brooding bass line and the urgent yet melodramatic vocals of Ivan Delint. Originally Ivan Delint’s solo project, the band has grown to include guitarist Steven Rivera (Shrouds), drummer Lock Noble, and Luis Posadas on Bass. They have opened for touring acts including ACTORS, Pink Turns Blue, and Modern English.\n\nBite Marx founder Colin Ambulance has been creating genuine, neurotic, verbose, aphoristic, and lurid electro/synth/postpunk since 2016, with his intense live performances now accompanied by a backing band including Annette Badalian on synth."
