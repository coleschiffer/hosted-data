His debut album “I Would Not Live Always” was released on Rough Trade imprint River Lea Records in 2020, earning rave reviews and winning 2 awards at the RTE Folk Awards. His second album \"Look Over the Wall, See the Sky\" has picked up where his debut left off, a bold and singular testimony that has won a nomination for Choice Album of the Year.\n\nThe critical acclaim John enjoys is in no small part thanks to his uncanny ability to masterfully unpick traditional songs and rearrange them with an emotional force. They float in a surreal space between the past and the present, the analog and the digital, between love and tragedy.The unconventional use of instruments and jagged arrangements gives the work a magnetism by drawing you into its curious orbit of experimental folk. Look Over The Wall, See The Sky is a re-imagining of traditional Irish music: powerful, hopeful and free."

Late night jam sessions in the midst of lockdown uncertainty slowly transformed into TREMOURS creative partnership, driven by the tension between Andino’s hazy, drifting guitars and Fryatt’s urgent, pulsating drums. Since forming, TREMOURS have undertaken three full US tours, most recently supporting label mates The Dandy Warhols and LSD and the Search for God, garnering a following across North America and Europe. TREMOURS also headlined Canada’s Cherry Cult Fest and embarked on their first UK tour. Fragments is their much-anticipated debut album, released on February 7, 2025 via Little Cloud Records.\n\nHEAVEN ride a massive sonic wave in delivering their dear and dreamy tracks. Matt Sumrow and Mikey Jones created Heaven in the wake of touring and recording with artists such as DEAN and BRITTA, SWERVEDRIVER, AMBULANCE LTD, CAVEMAN, the COMAS, the LEMONHEADS, and others. Now joined by bassist Sonia Manalili, after a deep collective pandemic slumber, the NYC based trio are prepping a new release and their most somnambulistic to date. Their 3rd full length Dream Aloud will be released April 4, 2025 on Little Cloud Records."

But for James’ third release, Medium Raw, producer and Easy Eye Sound label head Dan Auerbach envisioned something quite different for the Alabama-bred singer-songwriter- guitarist’s rawboned, sometimes scarifying music.\n\n“Day of the first session, I had my GPS routed to Easy Eye,” James recalls. “We ran into some traffic, and I texted \\[engineer M.\\] Allen \\[Parker\\] — ‘Hey man, sorry, we’re gonna be about 15 minutes late.’ And he said, ‘It’s OK, we’re still getting set up at the house.’ And I was like, ‘What house?’ ‘We’re recording at this house, it’s really cool.’ It was news to me! It felt unusual in the moment, which I think makes you play the songs differently. But I’m really happy with and proud of the results.”\n\n“I wanted to try to find that power of when I first saw him, when it was just him and his guitar,” Auerbach explains. “After working with him a couple of times in the studio, I felt like I wasn’t going to be able to do it in the same kind of way. The comforts and luxuries of the studio, where you’re able to hear everything and make adjustments and changes, wasn’t right for this project.”\n\n“Some of my favorite albums are those Arhoolie records produced by Chris Strachwitz that were recorded in houses, by Fred McDowell, Lightnin’ Hopkins. I felt like we might get better results if we did it in a house.”"

In a departure from the self-produced approach of her 2019 debut Refuge Cove and its 2022 follow-up Storm Queen—the Melbourne-based artist worked with producer Jonathan Wilson (Angel Olsen, Father John Misty, Margo Price) at his Topanga Canyon studio to dream up a lavishly orchestrated sound that fully accommodates the depth and scope of her vocal prowess.\n\nWith its visceral reflection on grief and self-destruction and emotional violence, Ramona brings a stunning new grandeur to Cummings’ music while refusing to soften or temper its humanity. “It’s emotional and grand, like a metamorphosis in real time,” Rolling Stone."

      "description": "shower curtain started as the solo project of Victoria Winter in 2018 in Curitiba, Brazil, and has since developed into a indie rock four piece based out of Brooklyn, NY alongside Ethan Williams (guitar/vocals), Sean Terrell (drums), and Cody Hudgins (bass). shower curtain brings dreamy melodies to the forefront of their music, bolstered by instrumental distortion and insulated by fuzz. Their debut album ‘words from a wishing well’ was released in October 2024 via Angel Tapes/Fire Talk Records, sketching early adulthood experiences in swirling layers of guitars, bringing the sludgy distortion of 90s shoegaze and grunge and establishing shower curtain as a standout in the city’s latest crop of bands."

      "name": "Stepping Stone Presents India Ramey w/ Nocona + DJ Dandy Randy",
      "description": "India Ramey blazes a trail through cinematic spaghetti western landscapes to wood floored Honkytonks and the Appalachian foothills. India’s musical journey was not typical. “Having grown up poor, there was a lot of pressure for me to ‘go to college and make money’ so I convinced myself that music was a hobby”. Ramey, a domestic violence survivor got a law degree and became a domestic violence prosecutor. “I thought if I was helping people like my Mom, I would like being a lawyer more”. Despite her love of helping people, Ramey’s love for music won in the end. She gave up her law career to become a full time musician and songwriter and has never looked back.\n\nSince then Ramey has put out five studio albums. Her 2017 album, and first national release, Snake Handler landed her on Rolling Stone's 10 New Country Artists You Need To Know list and earned her praise and attentions from American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation among others . Her 2020 album Shallow Graves earned her even more recognition from the likes of Ralph McClean of the BBC who said \"Ramey is a singer of the truth. Long may she shine\" and Rolling Stone who named her a pick of the week and featured a full interview and review calling her \"Part honky-tonk, part Black Sabbath\". She has been a two time SXSW and a three time Americanafest showcasing artist and recently released her fifth studio album, Baptized By The Blaze produced by Luke Wooten (The SteelDrivers, Sunny Sweeney, Deirks Bentley, Brad Paisley).\n\nReleased in August 2024, Baptized By The Blaze has taken off and is proving to be India's most successful album yet receiving high praise from Saving Country Music, No Depression, American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation and many more. She is touring extensively and has had the pleasure of opening for rising Outlaw Country and Americana star, Corb Lund and Grammy-nominated Maggie Rose. Ramey will start off her 2025 in the line-up of the Sirius XM Outlaw Country Cruise and has spring tour dates filling up her calendar."

      "name": "Grivo, Lockstep, Kraus, Seko",
      "description": "Emerging like an ornate relic, Austin-based power trio Grivo combines slow, methodical hooks and warm tube amplifiers to artfully re-establish the line between heavy guitars and downtempo pop. Within the tidal sound waves and bleak timbre, Grivo forges a distinctive personal connection that challenges the modern definitions of doom metal and shoegaze."

      "name": "Desert Daze Nights: Deaf Club w/ Object of Affection",
      "description": "Desert Daze Nights presents Deaf Club w/ Object of Affection!\n\nDeaf Club is a savage sound bath dripping with sardonicism: a blastbeat-centric hardcore punk assault channeling crust, thrash, and grind (un)sensibilities. Succinct pauses, surreal frequencies and effects, breakneck pace and sharply hurled vocals characterize the band’s aesthetic, which seems as though it is rooted in a sort of nasty-sound-meets-highbrow-message ethos. Fueled by the onslaught of society’s insanity and driven mad by tinnitus, Justin Pearson (The Locust, Dead Cross, Planet B), Brian Amalfitano (ACxDC), Scott Osment (Weak Flesh), and Jason Klein (Run With The Hunted), approach music as an opportunity to confront our collective sicknesses. We’ve got to try to listen, lest we all frolic headfirst towards the bright side of death, dragging this pillaged planet down with us. So whether you think the music is a radical disruption to the airwaves or just headache-inducing noise, you can feel free to tell them the brutal truth– they can’t hear you anyway."
