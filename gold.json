      "description": "Sid The Cat Presents\n\nCornelia Murr\n\nwith Luke Temple\n\n3/8/2025 at Gold-Diggers\n\n21+\n\nCornelia’s Murr’s newest album began with a question: What do I want? The answer is everything, and it’s never felt more urgent.\n\nOn her first LP in six years, Run To The Center, out February 28, 2025 on 22Twenty, the London-born singer-songwriter delivers her most confident, expansive album yet. Across 10 hypnotic pop songs is a fully realized portrait of a woman and an artist in her thirties, standing triumphantly in uncertainties, asking the crucial questions one needs to sustain a life: How can you fit everything you want into a life? How can you do this if you want so much?\n\nRun To The Center, which Murr will tour internationally next year, is her first release since her self-produced, six-track EP Corridor in 2022 and her first LP since her 2018 debut Lake Tear of the Clouds, produced by Jim James of My Morning Jacket. For years, Murr tried to make another LP, but extraneous forces kept getting in the way, whether economic or global.\n\nBut in the spring of 2023, Murr started working with prolific producer Luke Temple (Adrienne Lenker, Hand Habits), adding to her impressive list of collaborators, which includes Rodrigo Amarante, Alice Boman, Reverend Baron, and Oracle Sisters among many others. Temple was an old friend whom she had met in New York more than a decade prior. Finally, forces coalesced for them to work together. The result is a sweeping album of Murr’s most spectral and tender pop yet, born of a need to excavate her desires and experience of time, both in new songs born spontaneously out of an easy collaboration with Temple, as well as older songs that, for years, had been knocking around in her brain.\n\nRun To the Center is the most updated expression of who Murr is now, both sonically and emotionally, particularly as questions around artmaking have become more urgent for her over the better part of the last decade."

His debut album “I Would Not Live Always” was released on Rough Trade imprint River Lea Records in 2020, earning rave reviews and winning 2 awards at the RTE Folk Awards. His second album \"Look Over the Wall, See the Sky\" has picked up where his debut left off, a bold and singular testimony that has won a nomination for Choice Album of the Year.\n\nThe critical acclaim John enjoys is in no small part thanks to his uncanny ability to masterfully unpick traditional songs and rearrange them with an emotional force. They float in a surreal space between the past and the present, the analog and the digital, between love and tragedy.The unconventional use of instruments and jagged arrangements gives the work a magnetism by drawing you into its curious orbit of experimental folk. Look Over The Wall, See The Sky is a re-imagining of traditional Irish music: powerful, hopeful and free."

Since forming, TREMOURS have undertaken three full US tours, most recently supporting label mates The Dandy Warhols and LSD and the Search for God, garnering a following across North America and Europe. TREMOURS also headlined Canada’s Cherry Cult Fest and embarked on their first UK tour. Fragments is their much-anticipated debut album, released on February 7, 2025 via Little Cloud Records.\n\nHEAVEN ride a massive sonic wave in delivering their dear and dreamy tracks. Matt Sumrow and Mikey Jones created Heaven in the wake of touring and recording with artists such as DEAN and BRITTA, SWERVEDRIVER, AMBULANCE LTD, CAVEMAN, the COMAS, the LEMONHEADS, and others. Now joined by bassist Sonia Manalili, after a deep collective pandemic slumber, the NYC based trio are prepping a new release and their most somnambulistic to date. Their 3rd full length Dream Aloud will be released April 4, 2025 on Little Cloud Records."

But for James’ third release, Medium Raw, producer and Easy Eye Sound label head Dan Auerbach envisioned something quite different for the Alabama-bred singer-songwriter- guitarist’s rawboned, sometimes scarifying music.\n\n“Day of the first session, I had my GPS routed to Easy Eye,” James recalls. “We ran into some traffic, and I texted \\[engineer M.\\] Allen \\[Parker\\] — ‘Hey man, sorry, we’re gonna be about 15 minutes late.’ And he said, ‘It’s OK, we’re still getting set up at the house.’ And I was like, ‘What house?’ ‘We’re recording at this house, it’s really cool.’ It was news to me! It felt unusual in the moment, which I think makes you play the songs differently. But I’m really happy with and proud of the results.”\n\n“I wanted to try to find that power of when I first saw him, when it was just him and his guitar,” Auerbach explains. “After working with him a couple of times in the studio, I felt like I wasn’t going to be able to do it in the same kind of way. The comforts and luxuries of the studio, where you’re able to hear everything and make adjustments and changes, wasn’t right for this project.”\n\n“Some of my favorite albums are those Arhoolie records produced by Chris Strachwitz that were recorded in houses, by Fred McDowell, Lightnin’ Hopkins. I felt like we might get better results if we did it in a house.”"

      "description": "Sid The Cat Presents\n\nGrace Cummings\n\nwith Adriana McCassim\n\n4/5/2025 at Gold-Diggers\n\n21+\n\nCritically acclaimed Australian artist Grace Cummings hit a new high in 2024 with the release of third album, Ramona. “It felt like the wind of a hurricane entered the room,” said fan and new friend, Angel Olsen. “I remember feeling so activated and surprised by Grace’s vocal capacity that I actually felt my body brace itself against the wall.“\n\nAcclaimed worldwide in outlets ranging from PAPER to The Guardian, Uncut to NPR, Ramona is a work of raw truth rendered in its most beautiful form. In a departure from the self-produced approach of her 2019 debut Refuge Cove and its 2022 follow-up Storm Queen—the Melbourne-based artist worked with producer Jonathan Wilson (Angel Olsen, Father John Misty, Margo Price) at his Topanga Canyon studio to dream up a lavishly orchestrated sound that fully accommodates the depth and scope of her vocal prowess.\n\nWith its visceral reflection on grief and self-destruction and emotional violence, Ramona brings a stunning new grandeur to Cummings’ music while refusing to soften or temper its humanity. “It’s emotional and grand, like a metamorphosis in real time,” Rolling Stone."

His intuitive creative process often draws from traditional music and archival field recordings - incorporating elements of songs from the past into new work. He is, according to Ann Powers of NPR, \"maybe the leading interpreter of American folk music right now...\"\n\nFussell’s most recent album When I’m Called was released to critical acclaim by Fat Possum Records in the summer of 2024. The album was produced by James Elkington and features Blake Mills (guitars), Ben Whiteley (bass), and Joe Westerlund (drums), along with additional vocals from Joan Shelley and Robin Holcomb.\n\nFussell and Elkington also wrote and recorded the music for Rebuilding, a new feature film directed by Max Walker-Silverman that is set to premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n“Fussell’s music often comes with complex citations; he is a folksinger in the truest sense, collecting ideas and melodies and lyrics from distant and disparate traditions, looking for the things that unite us in our humanity.” - The New Yorker\n\n“(Fussell) is one of the great magpies of American song, collecting forgotten, tarnished gems with a folklorist’s zeal… his renditions aren’t so much cover versions as composites…” – The Guardian"

      "description": "India Ramey blazes a trail through cinematic spaghetti western landscapes to wood floored Honkytonks and the Appalachian foothills. India’s musical journey was not typical. “Having grown up poor, there was a lot of pressure for me to ‘go to college and make money’ so I convinced myself that music was a hobby”. Ramey, a domestic violence survivor got a law degree and became a domestic violence prosecutor. “I thought if I was helping people like my Mom, I would like being a lawyer more”. Despite her love of helping people, Ramey’s love for music won in the end. She gave up her law career to become a full time musician and songwriter and has never looked back.\n\nSince then Ramey has put out five studio albums. Her 2017 album, and first national release, Snake Handler landed her on Rolling Stone's 10 New Country Artists You Need To Know list and earned her praise and attentions from American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation among others . Her 2020 album Shallow Graves earned her even more recognition from the likes of Ralph McClean of the BBC who said \"Ramey is a singer of the truth. Long may she shine\" and Rolling Stone who named her a pick of the week and featured a full interview and review calling her \"Part honky-tonk, part Black Sabbath\". She has been a two time SXSW and a three time Americanafest showcasing artist and recently released her fifth studio album, Baptized By The Blaze produced by Luke Wooten (The SteelDrivers, Sunny Sweeney, Deirks Bentley, Brad Paisley).\n\nReleased in August 2024, Baptized By The Blaze has taken off and is proving to be India's most successful album yet receiving high praise from Saving Country Music, No Depression, American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation and many more. She is touring extensively and has had the pleasure of opening for rising Outlaw Country and Americana star, Corb Lund and Grammy-nominated Maggie Rose. Ramey will start off her 2025 in the line-up of the Sirius XM Outlaw Country Cruise and has spring tour dates filling up her calendar."
